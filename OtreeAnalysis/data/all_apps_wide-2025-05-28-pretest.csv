By ""beliefs"" we mean statements with a truth value, such as ""production animals are treated badly"" or ""meat consumption does not contribute to climate change"".  By ""attitudes"" and ""considerations"" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as ""I don't like meat"" or ""eating meat seems natural to me"".  We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as ""stances"".   ### Interview Transcript ###  - Q: How would you describe yourself politically? Would you call yourself a conservative or a liberal or something else? What does this mean to you? - A: In an American context I would call myself a liberal or a progressive probably; I mostly hold progressive or left-wing views--e.g., I am concerned about rising economic inequality, about growing anti-democratic and anti-immigration sentiments (generally populism and right-wing extremism). I am globally oriented, and believe that the most important challenges that we have (e.g., climate change is one of them) needs to be solved in supernational fora. Generally I am liberal, and believe that people should be able to live their lives the way that they want, as long as they do not infringe on the freedom of other people: for instance, I believe that most drugs should be legal, and I believe that LGBTQ people should have similar rights as more heteronormative people do.  - Q: What are some things that concern you in the political domain? Feel free to mention things that are important to you personally, or more long-term concerns or challenges for your country - A: Currently I am very concerned about the rise of extreme-right parties and populism globally. Of course Donald Trump in the US is the most clear example of this, but I am also concerned about the rapid rise of extreme right-wing parties in many european countries (e.g., Sweden, Germany, Austria). I am also concerned about economics right now, given that the global system is being shaken by both protectionistic and anti-globalist policies from the Trump administration and the war in Ukraine. More long-term I am concerned about climate change, which I see as one of the key challenges of my generation, and I am concerned about the future of Europe and the EU given that our economic growth is terrible, and that much of the key innovation (e.g., in AI, advanced chip manufacturing, etc.) is happening in the US and in China (and not in Europe).  - Q: Are there things about your country that make you feel proud or ashamed? Feel free to write about any features or events that come to mind - A: Proud might not be exactly the right word to describe this, but I am generally very happy about the way that the Danish society and system is structured. It is one of the least corrupt, most happy countries in the world. It is more egalitarian than most countries, offering generous unemployment benefits, free (you even get paid) education, and good universal health care coverage. Besides maybe taxes (where we pay more in Denmark) I think that Denmark is really a much more free country than the for instance the US: for instance, I had the freedom (or opportunity) to do a long education even though my parents do not make a lot of money, which would maybe not have been possible in many other countries.  - Q: Are there any political questions where you feel dissonance or conflict? Maybe something that is salient for you personally, or is discussed among your social contacts or in the media - A: I just had a very intense discussion recently with a good friend about whether (and when) to state your pronouns. For instance, on social media, twitter, work emails, in zoom calls etc. I do not think that we actually fundamentally agree on identity, gender, and LGBTQ+ questions (we are both leaning clearly progressive) but I feel mixed about putting this everywhere. I do think that the friend had a good point about this being important, and did add this in a few places (e.g., on twitter, work email). I think what bothers me a little bit about this is that I feel that the left is too focused on identity (gender, race, sex) and in general I think that class is a more fundamental and important axis that the progressive/left has emphasized too little.  - Q: Are there any more things that are important to you politically that we have not yet discussed? Feel free to write about anything that comes to mind - A: Maybe we have not talked so much about immigration, which is a tricky topic for me. Mostly, my politics align with left-wing parties, e.g., on LGBTQ, feminism, economic inequality, climate change, etc., but on immigration I am really split between different concerns. I am very much in favor of economic immigration and mobility broadly, but I do think that there are limits to the number of refugees and immigrants from culturally very dissimilar places that we can integrate. This places me somewhere weird in the middle between the proper left-wing, and the right wing, and is also one of the clashes that I have with the party that I vote for. Probably, again in a Danish context, I am more of a social democrat on this point.     ### Instructions ###  1. Identify stances (beliefs, attitudes, considerations): - Formulate each stance as a short statement starting exactly with: ""I agree with the following: <...>"". - Avoid empty statements such as ""some people avoid eating meat because of important reasons"". - Avoid statements that express more than one stance. Thus avoid words like ""and"" and instead break more complex stances up into simpler individual ones.  - Keep each statement short and concise and avoid filler words.  - Be direct in formulations (e.g. ""climate change is human caused"" is preferred to ""I believe that climate change is human caused""). - Avoid filler-words such as ""major"" (e.g. ""concern"" better than ""major concern"") and ""key"" (e.g., ""challenge"" better than ""key challenge""). - Aim for a maximum length of 4-8 words per stance formulation, and for a maximum of the 7 most important stances.  2. Rate importance for each stance: - Classify how important each stance (belief, attitude, consideration) is to the interviewee in the context of meat consumption. - Return your answer as one of [LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH] where LOW are not very important and HIGH are extremely important.   ### Output Format (JSON ONLY) ### { ""results"": [ {         ""stance"": ""I agree with the following: <stance>"",         ""importance"": ""<one of [LOW or MEDIUM or HIGH]>"", }, // Repeat for each stance expressed by the interviewee ] }  Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.

To me, this means I care deeply about equity in all its forms—economic, cultural, religious, etc.—and I support a highly democratic distribution of power. I fundamentally believe in the value of every human being, and that all people are equally valuable.","I am very much concerned about the polarization in the political domain. It's getting harder and harder to listen to different points of view and to inhabit grey areas, where black cannot be distinguished from white—or where such a distinction might not even apply. For example, when it comes to war, you can support and oppose a country's policy at the same time. Instead, it seems that we—and the media, and the way we discuss—tend to put things into boxes right away.    In the long run, this concerns me, as it won’t be possible to maintain the tension necessary for a functioning democracy. For a left-wing person like me, it’s too easy to fall into the trap of saying the right wing is crazy, radicalizing, and will start new wars. Instead, I need to force myself to listen to their points of view as much as possible—why they find it important to close borders (feeling insecure), return to tradition (a sense of anxiety from lacking stable reference points, I suppose), etc. And the same goes for right-wing people. We need to be able to listen to each other.    As for my own country, Italy, I am mainly concerned by the fact that the right wing is maintaining high levels of consensus without doing a good job. In foreign affairs, we seem to simply follow the USA and EU without a clear position. The government is not planning to invest in universities, research, or green transportation—all of which I care deeply about. It is even rolling back on important issues like moving toward a cashless society, LGBTQ+ rights, and opening the borders (instead trying to outsource migrants to Albania and pay that country to handle them however it chooses).

By ""beliefs"" we mean statements with a truth value, such as ""production animals are treated badly"" or ""meat consumption does not contribute to climate change"".  By ""attitudes"" and ""considerations"" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as ""I don't like meat"" or ""eating meat seems natural to me"".  We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as ""stances"".   ### Interview Transcript ###  - Q: How would you describe yourself politically? Would you call yourself a conservative or a liberal or something else? What does this mean to you? - A: I would describe myself as a left-leaning person. To me, this means I care deeply about equity in all its forms—economic, cultural, religious, etc.—and I support a highly democratic distribution of power. I fundamentally believe in the value of every human being, and that all people are equally valuable. - Q: What are some things that concern you in the political domain? Feel free to mention things that are important to you personally, or more long-term concerns or challenges for your country - A: I am very much concerned about the polarization in the political domain. It's getting harder and harder to listen to different points of view and to inhabit grey areas, where black cannot be distinguished from white—or where such a distinction might not even apply. For example, when it comes to war, you can support and oppose a country's policy at the same time. Instead, it seems that we—and the media, and the way we discuss—tend to put things into boxes right away.    In the long run, this concerns me, as it won’t be possible to maintain the tension necessary for a functioning democracy. For a left-wing person like me, it’s too easy to fall into the trap of saying the right wing is crazy, radicalizing, and will start new wars. Instead, I need to force myself to listen to their points of view as much as possible—why they find it important to close borders (feeling insecure), return to tradition (a sense of anxiety from lacking stable reference points, I suppose), etc. And the same goes for right-wing people. We need to be able to listen to each other.    As for my own country, Italy, I am mainly concerned by the fact that the right wing is maintaining high levels of consensus without doing a good job. In foreign affairs, we seem to simply follow the USA and EU without a clear position. The government is not planning to invest in universities, research, or green transportation—all of which I care deeply about. It is even rolling back on important issues like moving toward a cashless society, LGBTQ+ rights, and opening the borders (instead trying to outsource migrants to Albania and pay that country to handle them however it chooses). There is no long-term vision—just a strategy to maintain consensus.    Extremely important issues (also statistically significant) like systematically fighting the mafia, establishing a minimum wage (which, adjusted for inflation, is among the lowest in the OECD), and addressing tax evasion and corruption are being ignored—and that’s unacceptable.    Of course, I am also a pacifist, and wars like those in Ukraine and Palestine should stop immediately. But that is a broader issue than just my country. Still, we should take a stand.     - Q: Are there things about your country that make you feel proud or ashamed? Feel free to write about any features or events that come to mind - A: The list of things I am ashamed of could go on for a long time. One underlying problem is that we have retained a kind of cultural fascism without even being aware of it. Patriarchy is still deeply ingrained—we passively maintain traditional gender roles. We often feel a sense of superiority as Italians and seem to always need a leader to follow. This is strongly reflected in our police violence and the neglect of our prison system.

We have the resources and the talent. The real problem lies in politics and how we organize ourselves.     - Q: Are there any political questions where you feel dissonance or conflict? Maybe something that is salient for you personally, or is discussed among your social contacts or in the media - A: For example, abortion is a topic I tend to avoid, as I feel it is often misrepresented by both the left and the right. On the left, it can be treated as something unimportant, sometimes overlooking the emotional and physical consequences of the act. On the right, it is often treated as the only issue that matters, with people who have no choice but to go through with it being labeled as murderers—adding more suffering to an already difficult situation.

By ""beliefs"" we mean statements with a truth value, such as ""production animals are treated badly"" or ""meat consumption does not contribute to climate change"".  By ""attitudes"" and ""considerations"" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as ""I don't like meat"" or ""eating meat seems natural to me"".  We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as ""stances"".   ### Interview Transcript ###  - Q: How would you describe yourself politically? Would you call yourself a conservative or a liberal or something else? What does this mean to you? - A: [Joshua] I am fairly left wing with an emotionally lazy Realpolitik approach, certainly liberal of the two options. To me this means that there are certain values, such as equality (of opportunity) that I feel should be protected. I care a lot about positive freedoms, and believe the government should be in place to better people's opportunities. However, I have some paternalistic government leanings, as I have a low expectation of how well people are able to pursue the won goals.  - Q: What are some things that concern you in the political domain? Feel free to mention things that are important to you personally, or more long-term concerns or challenges for your country - A: Healthcare is important to me; cancer should not bankrupt people. Naturally, freedom of expression, open voting, democratic processes. I like immigrants and dislike racism. Economics I care about but not that much beyond some baseline that allows social security. The UK right now, and in other places, the rise of populism is unfortunate. I am concerned by backsliding on feminist issues.  - Q: Are there things about your country that make you feel proud or ashamed? Feel free to write about any features or events that come to mind - A: My UK has fairly good social security on the global stage but in recent years has been going in a worse direction. Honestly, I have absolutely no national pride, and my heart rate likely changed by a few beats a minute as the votes came in for Eurovision. The election turnout perhaps is something I find more shameful as the younger generation are not bothering to turn up (for some valid reasons) and then the old generation of people who will die before the consequences are dictating the direction of the country.  - Q: Are there any political questions where you feel dissonance or conflict? Maybe something that is salient for you personally, or is discussed among your social contacts or in the media - A: I think there are interesting difficult questions for trans issues but they are so overblown that I perhaps feel some dissonance but it is minor. Maybe I feel conflicted about inheritance tax;). One place for dissonance is liking democracy in practice but thinking that many people's vote should not count (not literally, of course). A little heavy-handed, but I feel conflict about various conflicts. That is, I think foreign aid should be a far larger donation, but I do have some genuine conflict about how people should spend money helping 'themselves' first.  - Q: Are there any more things that are important to you politically that we have not yet discussed? Feel free to write about anything that comes to mind - A: I would not add any political beliefs. It is odd as many issues to me are objectively important, but of little personal importance to me.   ### Instructions ###  1.

By ""beliefs"" we mean statements with a truth value, such as ""production animals are treated badly"" or ""meat consumption does not contribute to climate change"".  By ""attitudes"" and ""considerations"" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as ""I don't like meat"" or ""eating meat seems natural to me"".  We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as ""stances"".   ### Interview Transcript ###  - Q: How would you describe yourself politically? Would you call yourself a conservative or a liberal or something else? What does this mean to you? - A: I am a left and green person. I think it is very important to ensure social justice through political laws. This means constrain companies, individuals, ... . WE should not destroy the planet or other countries with our actions   - Q: What are some things that concern you in the political domain? Feel free to mention things that are important to you personally, or more long-term concerns or challenges for your country - A: Climate change, social justice, taxes, environment, immigration is important as well, how can we make sure all people live a good life  - Q: Are there things about your country that make you feel proud or ashamed? Feel free to write about any features or events that come to mind - A: I think trying to be fair in international politics. Perhaps the ""Wir schaffen das"" from Angela Merkel in 2015.    Most ashamed, clearly Nazi-Reich  - Q: Are there any political questions where you feel dissonance or conflict? Maybe something that is salient for you personally, or is discussed among your social contacts or in the media - A: No, i think i am quite consistently left. What I donÄt like about my friends opinions is when they argue that everyone should just simply get more money. This is ""left"" but I think it is often not what I think - Q: Are there any more things that are important to you politically that we have not yet discussed? Feel free to write about anything that comes to mind - A: nah  ### Instructions ###  1. Identify stances (beliefs, attitudes, considerations): - Formulate each stance as a short statement starting exactly with: ""I agree with the following: <...>"". - Avoid empty statements such as ""some people avoid eating meat because of important reasons"". - Avoid statements that express more than one stance. Thus avoid words like ""and"" and instead break more complex stances up into simpler individual ones.  - Keep each statement short and concise and avoid filler words.  - Be direct in formulations (e.g. ""climate change is human caused"" is preferred to ""I believe that climate change is human caused""). - Avoid filler-words such as ""major"" (e.g. ""concern"" better than ""major concern"") and ""key"" (e.g., ""challenge"" better than ""key challenge""). - Aim for a maximum length of 4-8 words per stance formulation, and for a maximum of the 7 most important stances.  2. Rate importance for each stance: - Classify how important each stance (belief, attitude, consideration) is to the interviewee in the context of meat consumption. - Return your answer as one of [LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH] where LOW are not very important and HIGH are extremely important.   ### Output Format (JSON ONLY) ### { ""results"": [ {         ""stance"": ""I agree with the following: <stance>"",         ""importance"": ""<one of [LOW or MEDIUM or HIGH]>"", }, // Repeat for each stance expressed by the interviewee ] }  Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.

By ""beliefs"" we mean statements with a truth value, such as ""production animals are treated badly"" or ""meat consumption does not contribute to climate change"".  By ""attitudes"" and ""considerations"" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as ""I don't like meat"" or ""eating meat seems natural to me"".  We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as ""stances"".   ### Interview Transcript ###  - Q: How would you describe yourself politically? Would you call yourself a conservative or a liberal or something else? What does this mean to you? - A: I am not entirely sure where I fall between conservative or a liberal, maybe slightly a bit more liberal in a sense that I like to see progressive actions / new changes compared to upholding traditional values. I am, however, not that active politically, so I cannot say much - Q: What are some things that concern you in the political domain? Feel free to mention things that are important to you personally, or more long-term concerns or challenges for your country - A: What do you mean by political domain? If it's about the politicians, then I can say that their inefficiency. Bureaucracy does not work to improve welfare, especially for people who place in the bottom rungs. Wealth inequality despite ever growing productivity. Corruption. - Q: Are there things about your country that make you feel proud or ashamed? Feel free to write about any features or events that come to mind - A: I am ashamed by the massive corruption cases that deprive people from enjoying public goods. Something that I am proud of is about how inventive/opportunity-seeking  - Q: Are there any political questions where you feel dissonance or conflict? Maybe something that is salient for you personally, or is discussed among your social contacts or in the media - A: I think it's hard to defend my belief about punishing bad actors for their deeds. Sometimes punishment can work but sometimes it doesn't. I sometimes think a harsh punishment is good to set the norms clear to others, but then it kind of incentivises harming people.  - Q: Are there any more things that are important to you politically that we have not yet discussed? Feel free to write about anything that comes to mind - A: No not really  ### Instructions ###  1. Identify stances (beliefs, attitudes, considerations): - Formulate each stance as a short statement starting exactly with: ""I agree with the following: <...>"". - Avoid empty statements such as ""some people avoid eating meat because of important reasons"". - Avoid statements that express more than one stance. Thus avoid words like ""and"" and instead break more complex stances up into simpler individual ones.  - Keep each statement short and concise and avoid filler words.  - Be direct in formulations (e.g. ""climate change is human caused"" is preferred to ""I believe that climate change is human caused""). - Avoid filler-words such as ""major"" (e.g. ""concern"" better than ""major concern"") and ""key"" (e.g., ""challenge"" better than ""key challenge""). - Aim for a maximum length of 4-8 words per stance formulation, and for a maximum of the 7 most important stances.  2. Rate importance for each stance: - Classify how important each stance (belief, attitude, consideration) is to the interviewee in the context of meat consumption. - Return your answer as one of [LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH] where LOW are not very important and HIGH are extremely important.   ### Output Format (JSON ONLY) ### { ""results"": [ {         ""stance"": ""I agree with the following: <stance>"",         ""importance"": ""<one of [LOW or MEDIUM or HIGH]>"", }, // Repeat for each stance expressed by the interviewee ] }  Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.

By ""beliefs"" we mean statements with a truth value, such as ""production animals are treated badly"" or ""meat consumption does not contribute to climate change"".  By ""attitudes"" and ""considerations"" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as ""I don't like meat"" or ""eating meat seems natural to me"".  We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as ""stances"".   ### Interview Transcript ###  - Q: How would you describe yourself politically? Would you call yourself a conservative or a liberal or something else? What does this mean to you? - A: I would call myself left-wing, and increasingly so. I feel that there is a lot of injustice in the way our societies are structured, and a long history of inequality that has been worsening in recent decades. On top of that, we are running up against planetary limits. To me, being left-wing means paying attention to power relations and working for better alternatives. - Q: What are some things that concern you in the political domain? Feel free to mention things that are important to you personally, or more long-term concerns or challenges for your country - A: Worsening inequality, the alienation produced by living under late capitalism (spiritual and embodied as well as intellectual), increasing polarization and the decay of public discourse -- so much so that it is becoming difficult to talk to people who disagree with us. Climate change and species extinction is always looming, and it feels that we are not addressing it properly. For my country (UK): the feebleness of Labour and their acceptance of the drift towards the right. - Q: Are there things about your country that make you feel proud or ashamed? Feel free to write about any features or events that come to mind - A: About the UK: I'm proud of the friendliness we still have towards each other and the humour we've hung onto. I enjoy its diversity, especially in the cities. I'm ashamed of the small-mindedness and racism that takes hold of us sometimes, and of our tolerance of inequality. - Q: Are there any political questions where you feel dissonance or conflict? Maybe something that is salient for you personally, or is discussed among your social contacts or in the media - A: Sometimes I feel like the tone of discourse on social media and media more generally, in which people are attacked for their personal beliefs, is counterproductive. I often feel like I am being asked to get onto a bandwagon of ""bashing the Tories"" or ""TERFs"" etc., but I feel dissonance about this. I feel discomfort whenever my ""us and them"" impulse is being stimulated. The trans debate I feel is particularly polarized so that we aren't actually listening to each other. So I feel dissonance about being asked (implicitly) to condemn those with different beliefs. - Q: Are there any more things that are important to you politically that we have not yet discussed? Feel free to write about anything that comes to mind - A: I think what gets left out of politics sometimes is the imagination of different structures, different ways of being and living. What you hear in the media is narrowed drastically and doesn't represent the full range of human possibilities. I think we can learn from ancient and indigenous societies about alternatives, and experiment with putting them into practice.  ### Instructions ###  1. Identify stances (beliefs, attitudes, considerations): - Formulate each stance as a short statement starting exactly with: ""I agree with the following: <...>"". - Avoid empty statements such as ""some people avoid eating meat because of important reasons"". - Avoid statements that express more than one stance. Thus avoid words like ""and"" and instead break more complex stances up into simpler individual ones.  - Keep each statement short and concise and avoid filler words.  - Be direct in formulations (e.g. ""climate change is human caused"" is preferred to ""I believe that climate change is human caused""). - Avoid filler-words such as ""major"" (e.g. ""concern"" better than ""major concern"") and ""key"" (e.g., ""challenge"" better than ""key challenge""). - Aim for a maximum length of 4-8 words per stance formulation, and for a maximum of the 7 most important stances.  2. Rate importance for each stance: - Classify how important each stance (belief, attitude, consideration) is to the interviewee in the context of meat consumption. - Return your answer as one of [LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH] where LOW are not very important and HIGH are extremely important.   ### Output Format (JSON ONLY) ### { ""results"": [ {         ""stance"": ""I agree with the following: <stance>"",         ""importance"": ""<one of [LOW or MEDIUM or HIGH]>"", }, // Repeat for each stance expressed by the interviewee ] }  Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
