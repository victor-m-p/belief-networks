leaning media would serve the country well unlike fox to advocate for doing the right thing this cop should be fired for starters as should all cops who bully are vengeful and clearly aren't suited to police americans we need to get them all fired one bad cop at a time as we remember that good cops who look the other way can't be good cops anymore this is why we all we all citizens should support taking the cultural pressure off the good cops by insisting on body cams and having independent review boards focus on complaints using that evidence with the specific objective of clearing our discredited police departments out of these jackasses common sense and history has shown that people of every stripe cannot investigate themselves we must demand our legislatures give us institutional independent prosecutions because prosecutors too are in a horrible political position to look the other way as well so not to alienate vengeful cops they must have to win prosecutions if prosecutors

they'll quit because bullies are cowards and that's what we really want them to do quit or be fired their choice simply watch a few episodes of cops to see those bad actors work too hard to inflict pain street justice and lie to incarcerate people just because they have the power to intimidate those less smart that culture forgets what it's like not to be a cop exclusive there's a difference

dont' accept and guess what police behavior isn't up to them it's up to us for they serve us at our pleasure not theirs if they dont' like it don't become a cop we require you to have more patience and less military demeanor with us cops is a manual for how to talk dumber people into giving up their constitutional rights and do you ever see cops read people their rights and admonish them to stfu

que borrarlo del mapa de la tierra por eso no me extra a que ocasio los califique de odiadores debido a que su odio envenenado es algo que no pueden ocultar en la forma en que transmiten sus informaciones sobre sus contrarios es algo que no ocultan el llamado constante a luchar de forma violenta y por el metodo que sea contra el socialismo es una constante en esta prensa favorable al sistema capitalista no se esconden para decirlo no tienen reparo en hacerlo y siempre tratan de decirnos que solo en el sistema de vida capitalista los seres humanos peden ser libres solamente y que si se comete alguna injusticia contra usted las leyes de la sociedad impediran que usted sea maltratado o no reciba justicia como sucede en el sistema socialista segun ellos pero en los paises capitalistas quienes son la mayoria de los paises en el mundo es donde mas pobres y personas viviendo lo mismo como indigentes que como homeless existen si miramos el mapa mundial veremos que la mayoria de la poblaci n mundial vive en paises capitalistas y no en paises llamados socialistas desde pracicamente el surgimiento de los sistemas sociales que conocemos aunque mas bien pudieramos llamar a estos paises dictaduras socialistas de nuevo tipo la verdad es que no se como la prensa capitalista se atreve a llamar a el derrocamiento de los llamados paises socialistas cuando las mayores injusticias estan hoy por hoy en el sistema capitalista me imagino que lo hacen para tapar la suciedad de sus sociedades la poca libertad individual en los paises socialistas y la falta de libertad de expresi n o el castigo por espresarse en contra de los gobiernos en estos paises a sido muy bien aprovechado por la prensa capitalista para ocultar los defectos del capitalismo como sistema social
