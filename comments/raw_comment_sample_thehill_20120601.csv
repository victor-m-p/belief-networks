710109851,make a real deal or make the sequestration cuts that was the agreement no weaseling out of it buck
710109851,buck mckeon r calif are you kidding me i blame bo on many things but not this one didn't the gop sign up to this didn't the gop reject a proposal to cut spending coupled with some tax increases sorry but this is what you guys agreed to maybe just maybe if those old proposals were back on the table something can get done
710109851,it turns out that chip brogan is a phony conservative who is pursuing a gay marriage with h abe they live in a van with van jones in san fran true story
710109851,eisenhower called it right about the military industrial complex
710109851,the refusal to increase the debt limit without spending cuts gave birth to sequestration and now the republicans want to abort
710109851,ike could have never envisioned the social justice complex that we have today atleast with the dod we are constitutionally mandated and really necessary
710109851,you're right on tea party proud and i'm a moderate dem talking sides agreed to this buck get over it and quit trying to change the rules midstream
710109851,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha mckeon tries to pull a 'do as i say do not as i do' and got caught by the big bad jam it in your as machine today wwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaa
710109851,obama is irresponsible the sequester which was to force a deal has failed he is now asking the republicans who have produced a budget in the house to reject it as a condition before he will do anything he wants them to be as irresponsible as he is this is evidence that he is the most irresponsible president ever on national defense all the time leaking information about the seals approving the killing of terrorists while preening about gitmo but denying us the ability to interrogate them to gather information that would protect the country his actions are incoherent and without sound basis he is not leading on defense he is making us weaker by chest thumping he has shown he does not know how to lead if he did he would have kept his mouth shut kept the details secret and taken the lead to get this sequester mess fixed
710109851,how dare they stick to the deal that both sides agreed to mckeon is a blowhard
710109851,i'm shocked shocked that our elected officials have turned our military into a poker chip in their game of high stakes power politics for the second time today shame on all of you and a pox on both your houses
710109851,buck it looks like the gop needs to get off its high horse and negotiate just like the founding fathers intended
710109851,a voice of reason from the tea party i'm impressed
710109851,actually there are many tea party types that are moderate in many aspects we all agree the debt is killing the country some are willing to take the center road to address it sensible tax increases enforce the tax laws cut spending reduce regulations where possible and educate people so that they can get solid jobs
710109851,dwight d eisenhower award from the national defense industrial association i may be mistaken but i believe it was ike that warned us against the 'military industrial complex' seems strange to me that the ndia would name their award after their probalby most credible and prescient critic
710109851,didn't he vote for the budget control act now he's pandering to the military industrial complex association ha
710109851,come it's obama's fault no matter what president romney will have every right to blame obama for everything gw will be at home in tx laughing his azz off
710109851,great michelle you're right elected or not obama will be remembered for his failures his hopey thing turned into a dopey thing anyone who voted for him is without a doubt clueless and just plain stupid
710109851,right failures like killing obl after bush did nothing to do it
710109851,i like you neocon crybabies especially since you were kicked out in
710109851,van jones is an american environmental advocate civil rights activist and attorney jones is a co founder of three non profit organizations in he founded the ella baker center for human rights a california non governmental organization working for alternatives to violence in he co founded color of change an advocacy group for african americans in he founded green for all a national ngo dedicated to building an inclusive green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty his first book the green collar economy was released on october and reached number on the new york times best seller list in time magazine named jones one of its heroes of the environment fast company called him one of the most creative minds of
710109851,mckeon ought to be ashamed of himself he's willing to see the country go further into debt and deeper in the hole he and his war machine comrades salivate for as a republican i am ashamed of mckeon he truly represents what is wrong with congress all he knows is spend spend spend mckeon is truly no better than reid they are both career politicians who need to be retired this country needs to find ways to reduce it's trillion deficit neither harry reid nor buck mckeon have a clue as to how it will be done yet they are responsible for it
710109851,i think the headline is misleading aren't the obama administration and sen reid enforcing sequestration not ignoring it
710109851,more flatulence from these right wing gasbags
710109851,the country would be a better place if all tea party republicans had your attitude we may disagree on a lot of issues but i agree with you on this one isn't this a case of 'watch what you wish for' i happen to be a 'liberal' that believes in a strong military that being said i doubt the sequester is going to hurt that much because i bet there is at least that much savings with military waste and redundancies
710109851,there are no terrorists to interrogate because obama kills them all dead something bush and cheney utterly failed to do in their lust to use as a pretext to take iraq's oil
710109851,whoa there obama asked for a hike in the debt ceiling like they have been requested many times before and never questioned never the repubs said no obama and boehner worked out a deal the repubs said no to save face mcconnel asked for the 'super committee' with the sequester as a fall back if no agreement repubs don't want any tax increases because of grover's threats so the sequester goes into effect so you blaming obama is a bit wrong try blaming grover he's the reason the military is weakened
710109851,i wouldn't call spending like a drunken sailor as obama and reid do very often as being thrifty these two liberal dirt bags need to put america first for a change instead of their own personal and political agenda and that doesn't mean swelling the welfare role when will liberals ever learn that entitlement programs are sucking the life out of this nation and they want to expand on this dum mass liberals
710109851,hey graham please get your facts right stop barfing up the hannity crap that you swallowed last night
710109851,so according to graham obama is irresponsible but mckeon who welched on his agreement is great lolz do you really need nuclear aircraft carriers in order to defend the border of america not counting guam hawaii
710109851,ron where can i read your comments about objecting to cheney's 'defecit's don't matter' bit just curious why you're only complaining that the black dude is in charge
710109851,i have to use that line on a far right wing extremist at some point
710109851,where in the constitution do you need nuclear aircraft carriers or submarines please you're just another military industrial complex supporter
710109851,obama himself complained when bush raised the debt limit stood up before everyone and gave a big long speech about how it was gw's monumental failure to raise the debit limit u need to know a little recent history ur talking out of your nethers
710109851,i just got off the phone with one of the girls i knocked up damn i still like her
710109851,shut up commie

710109851,cool then let's cuts all the social services the million cell phones we pay for and their monthly bill
710109851,fact some just wanted the across the board cut called sequestration changed to just a cut at same amount but defense department picks and chooses where to cut not across all defense departments we need spending cuts first until it hurts then raise small amount left in taxes to balance
710109851,well now there are some real credible references you have told half truths all over bush didn't go to war by himself the dems had been screaming for it all through clinton's admin look up all their quotes
710109851,tsk tsk another lie who in the he ll do you think put together seal team six cheney they did stop one mission due to the fact it had grown too massive and cheney was worried about the safety of our troops i take it you never served since you have no grasp on how things are done
710109851,well put if he would get off the drugs once in awhile he might think more rationally he speaks with forked tongue if it is his idea it is great if a republican comes up with one he hates it but then takes credit like getting bin ladin the general gave the order o had to bodily taken off the golf course let's not forget his own dem senate voted down his budget multiple times now the dems are backing away as they well should
710109851,fact wud yo talkin abot buckwheat romney crack corn in
710109851,van jones is an admitted communist that is funded totally by george soros jones is a major pos
710109851,big governmental cuts are badly needed especially in dod for a decade they have spent like well drunken sailors and now its time to tighten their belts too many years of squandering tax dollars with zero accountability has weakened our country defense contractors however have greedily profited from this reckless largess at taxpayers expense and detriment too much reckless non national defense operations are bankrupting us large cuts needed now
710109851,you mean when cinton did nothing which cause
710109851,did anyone notice that buck does not mean the buck stops here has he ever advocated a republican war tax to pay for bush's wars against iraq and afghanistan libya yemen iran somalia etc he is a typical evangelical corporate republican i have mine i'll take yours and the rest of you can go to hell
710109851,let me have a puff on that before you throw it away jackass
710109851,the constitution doesn't say to bankrupt the country with wasteful defense spending you right wing loons are like a broken record with your constant braying about defense spending being in the constitution get a life
710109851,well why did your party agree to the process to start with you are frigging idiots is why all of them both parties they act like elected royalty and have little to do with the common american
710109851,let them raise your taxes just like our founding fathers didn't intend fool
710109851,wh at gl enn sa id i am taken by sur prise that you can make in four weeks on the int ernet ha ve you se en this we bpage c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710109851,this is rubbish buck and you know it your party wants to force its domestic agenda on the country in support of the military industrial complex you agreed to sequestration as the negative outcome of your party's inability to negotiate the grand agreement on the deficit now be a man and stand up for your word the military budget is not about workfroce devleopment for the defense industry that's nonsense it should be about defense of the country with a st century approach not something left over from the obsolete cold war era your thinking is out of date damage to our national security is wrapping yourself in the flag something that politicans do so well and without much meaning you may be sincere but you need to listen to the rest of the country and not just your far right colleagues stop being a politican and become a statesman please
710109851,stop forcing you ads on a serious discussion site hazel you are a con man
710109851,you too are a con person counting on making money from people for sign ups only kinda like the stuffing envelopes deals of the past
710109851,page margin in p margin bottom in perhaps citizens should be provided with a complete list of defense projects its easy to say dont cut spending it will hurt our national security average people might not know or understand some of the programs considered defense projects average people will have limited thought and have a knee jerk reaction to fake fear by and large the citizens may be shocked with some of the programs their tax dollars are paying for perhaps even revolted who knows if the projects were published perhaps more savings could be made how many projects like intentional infections of populations kind of like what has happened before what does the average citizen really know how can any citizen make an informed decision on such a matter you would have to trust those that say trust us i wouldn't they are the ones to stab you in the back each time if they want their budget make a complete list of projects secrets hide more then what they should legitimately used for they provide cover for scams and corruption i bet the average republican and democrat have had enough of paying for scams and corruption unfortunately the secrecy surrounding defense budgets provides for a breeding ground of perverse corruption so before you make a decision ask yourself do you really know given the information you have no would you by a car from a used car salesman sight unseen the government claims they want open society just not for tax payer funded projects marked as secret its no secret what most people think about government and trust these days understandably if someone tries to use fear to motivate its usually false they are hiding something laugh
710109851,we all know bo is a liar so what's new only diehards who will not admit their mistakes still support him his administration as he promised was going to be a transparent administration there has been nothing that has been transparent from the beginning except truly lies to defeat america and weaken the american businesses economy and people
710109851,fact i think we need a mix of spending cuts spears out across all departments inducing the military and raise in tax more on the rich then the middle class
710109851,it is amazing that the republicans would not work out a deal to prevent the sequestration in the supper committee and settled for it and now are blaiming the democrats have you ever noticed that the republicans will never except blame for anthing they do their spending and tax cut for the wealthy over the past plus years created this problem now they want the to pay for their bungling policies
710109851,mckeon is right on target if sequestration goes into effect the military will have to cut civilian personnel and spending at domestic bases overseas bases must be protected at all costs if we do not protect the overseas bases our allies will not be able to cut their military budgets and we will not be able to go to war against despots of the world
710109851,ju st as judy expl ained i cant bel ieve th at any b ody able to pr ofit in wee ks on the in ternet did you see th is w eb li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710109851,well the article doesn't involve cheney otherwise we would complain about the white guy named cheney instead were complaining about the other white guy president barack obama he is actaully mostly white and that percentage of black in him is meaningless to everyone except you racists
710109851,what's the difference between political grandstanding obama and political suicide repubs
710109851,how about where it the constitution says provide for the common defense btw it doesn't mention muskets either
710109851,the dems are trying to destroy america obama wants us to be like france
710109851,further proof that canadians should run american domestic and foreign policies you're too stupid to run it yourself
710109851,cia couldn't certify it get your facts right
710109851,last i checked nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers aren't being used to defend america's border nor are either items all that common in the world glazi do you want to go again
710109851,hu what that social service phone bill that phones are provided by a rd party company read the fine print
710109851,yet ron gives boehner and house republicans a pass when they pass bills to the senate that are not paid for what so ever why is that ron
710109851,i'm just curious why ron never complained about cheney's spending thats' all hypocrisy makes you ignorant and makes you ignored
710109851,further proof that canadians should we ever have to set up a security zone around canada will shoot dummies who pose a threat to canadian soverignty
710109851,george soros fights commies glenn do you admit to being a commie
710109851,you don't consider our shores a border additionally when we project power over there we keep our enemies too busy to bother us over here it's called defense in depth or would you rather we save all sorts of cash and simply turn over control of the seas to the russians chinese heck the north koreans for that matter as to whether they are common items though aircraft carriers are largely our invention and our task force primary the russians have also had them for quite a long time long enough to be able to sell an older one to the chinese who are now using it for testing and trials have you seen their new stealthy dragon fighter some very very impressive flying at the air shows finally i have no idea of your age or experience nor do i think it germane to the topic but i'm tired of seeing the u s a drawing down our military after wars only to have to scramble to catch up to the next one when we find ourselves inadequately armed for the conflict which by the way cost a lot more than if we had simply kept ourselves at strength all along when we draw down we lose experienced well trained personnel that are very hard to replace our remaining personnel see their skill sets atrophy from non or reduced use we are weaker and more vulnerable and our forces' morale suffers and when we are vulnerable the world knows it and makes plans accordingly perhaps not through a plan for direct attack on our country but very likely they will engage in behavior that were we at strength they would not even dream of attempting and before you ask yes i am a veteran as for going again i'm not fighting you rather i'm attempting to make a case for a strong u s military your turn make your case thank you
710109851,those come out of tax money hince entitlements it doesn't matter what company we pay for it
710109851,that is too stupid to comment to

710109851,george soros fights commies even glen beck has said that george soros has helped anti communist and anti russian interest revolutions even glen beck said so so glenn if you're against george soros you must be a commie
710109851,if other countries overseas want a military might i suggest they pay for it like canada does
710109851,did you even bother to read and comprehend my previous post this is like trying to argue with a graffiti filled wall and since you've felt it necessary to devolve to personal insults it seems you've exhausted rational arguments for your case to paraphrase an oft cited quote you have remove d all doubt i thank you for trying to present an argument don't be discouraged you can improve
710147732,they can't stop spending can they budget up by million
710147732,the site is bought and paid for it should be kept open and utilized as intended
710147732,obama plans to stop everything that is not a liberal or socialist idea hurry up nov
710147732,june to the editor as i read mrs xxxxxxx rebuttal to my letter i could not help but recall that movie the titanic by james cameron in my minds eye i can clearly see mrs xxxxxx standing outside the wheel house cheering on captain obama as he steers the ship of state not only into the iceberg but then throws the ship into full reverse to hit it again just to be sure the ship is absolutely going to sink whether it is obama cuomo or even weiner they are all reading from the same playbook written by liberal democrat after liberal democrat spend more promise more borrow more regulate more fight wars only when we run them otherwise wail like stuck pigs against them and last but not least don t mind the stench of hypocrisy oh no we must full our noses with as much sanctimonious but its for the children as will fit to mask the stench my life experience guided by what i know to be true says we are in deep trouble and i m trying to ring the alarm with these letters if all of you want to live out the last days of prosperity in placid ignorance you have that right because better men and these days women from our local police and fire force s right on up to every soul in the united state military step into the breach to give you that opportunity i recommend a hot cup of tea and the liberal media of your choice that does not challenge any assumption you have been taught to bleep just like the phd xxxxxxx has done with such seeming certitude along with your thoughts in the same paper you know hold in your hands i say nuts to all of it we are trillions in debt and deficit and our problems from not having opened yucca mountain to secure nuclear waste to the atf letting thousands of guns in to the wrong hands only increases my angst we are free and will remain so because we cherish debate and the ballot and we can alter our course through that ballot box we have for almost three generations accepted the notion that the liberal philosophy in either how we fight wars or how we live our daily lives is the answer to accomplish this both political parties have engaged in the you scratch my back i ll scratch your s act this go along to get along attitude has led us to a decade of combat against one side of the same muslim arab coin a destroyed dollar and diminished standing among the free nations of the world and a fantasy land interest rate environment that only bozo the clown banker could love americans don t lead by bowing to dictators or by apology they hold their hand out and say to the world that we will do our level best to help you realize your freedom but will not give up our freedom to be safe because as benjamin franklin once said a nation that is willing to give up its freedom for security will soon have neither i may not be the smartest man but i think old franklin knew a thing or two about what it took to get the freedom that we seem so willing to give up and hand our children my children the mastercard bill for joe doakes
710147732,well spoken sir thank you
710147732,hurry up nov so obama can stop everything that is not a liberal
710147732,he has nearly achieved his objective joe he's already hammered the american citizenry on this nation with his failed policies say joe did you read the economy report out today sux don't it thats your leader joe the failed leader at that
710147732,as a kid of back in i used to be in las vegas with our parents my sister i would watch the night sky turn into daylight during the nuke tests in the desert i don't buy that storing nuke waste deep in a mountain is a bad thing today
710147732,if you live in nevada you are happy about the decision the criticism has to do with geopolitics much like the farm bill
710147732,good for norm dicks too bad more of his party doesn't get it
710147732,the place is perhaps one of the most baren on earth if it isn't utilized then where should all the radioactive material be sent
710147732,glad to see the obama bundler slush funds have been dropped from the budget he won't need them anyway after he loses miserably in november
710147732,how about washington d c lets dump it all there
710147732,hear hear
710147732,the question is nuclear safety at the nuclear power plants and storage of the spent fules at those plants yucca mountain is the best possible facility for storage of the spent fules
710147732,as cl ifford res ponded i di dnt kno w that som eone can get pa id in one mo nth on the int ernet ha ve you re ad t his li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710147732,and when all you bring to bear to support your opinion that we are in deep trouble is your opinion joe then there's much left to be desired
710147732,sounds like good sarcasm is it you mean he plans to stop friedman economic liberalism
710147732,washington state has a major problem with the storing of nuclear wastes where was murray and cantwell on this issue but kissing obama and reid butts
710147732,i lived in nevada for many years and the yucca mountain area has been the location of hundreds if not thousands of nuclear bomb explosions most underground so the issue of radiation leaking into the colorado river is a red herring a weak strawman or a outright lie if that was possible all the previous bombs and year half life would have gotten to the river decades ago the storage facility is designed to store the materials encased in glass and other materials that can not be leached into the ground water it is pure e green efforts to kill nuclear by making it to expense to use the retired past president of the sierra club said his greatest mistake was to help kill the nuclear power industry as it is the best safest cleanest source of energy
710147732,i think that we should give up on planning to store high level waste from nuclear power plants for years i think that we should re process the waste fuel to extract fuel grade uranium for use in conventional nuclear power plants repeated recycling of the waste fuel will yield decreasing quantities of high level waste ultimately we could wind up with smaller quantities of low grade waste which we could store in yucca mountain a by product of the extraction will be weapons grade plutonium that will require great care we do not want that material to find its way into the hands of those who would harm us however we can construct nuclear power plants that use the plutonium to produce additional electricity these reactors will require extraordinary security protection but epa is all about recycling so they should love it we probably need to store waste at yucca for several years until the new infrastructure is in place so it will need facilities for retrieval from storage
710147732,ju st as sh irley res ponded i'm ala rmed that a stud ent can make in a few we eks on the inte rnet did you re ad this li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710147732,i am sorry but what does this have to do with the article is your new job shipping nuclear waste
710147732,how about transitioning away from nuclear energy so they can stop adding to the nuclear waste amounts nuclear energy only provides of the energy in the u s of energy and trillions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies and leaving a legacy of deadly nuclear waste for thousands of years is it worth it no is it necessary no nuclear meltdowns have caused radiation in our food and water supply we could easily conserve of energy and transition into renewable energy sources like europe is doing so successfully and with renewable energy like solar wind geothermal and tidal wave there's no need to go to war for oil etc with renewable energy there is clean energy independence iceland utilizes of geothermal energy successfully germany utilizes wind and solar hugely successfully denmark utilizes wind energy hugely successfully renewable energy is so successful that germany has to turn off the wind power because it's creating too much energy the trillions of dollars that has been invested in nuclear energy which is such a heavy polluter and since fukushima and chernobyl has shown us is so dangerous should be used to fund renewable energy
710147732,i inspected yucca mountain in and found it to be potentially a massive disaster because of the presences of a layer of non tufted rock above the location for the waste tunnels the presence of four active earthquake faults cutting through both the tunnel locations and the rock layer and the tunnel's temperature when filled of about degrees c even a small earthquake could flood the tunnels the water flash to steam and the mountain explode the fallout would be the equivalent of millions of nagasaki a bombs and would contaminate up to states i find it hard to believe that the doe hasn't seen this already burying waste in the ground is a losing proposition far better to use something similar to the process in patent and eliminate the waste from our environment completely
710147732,the unethical billions spent on solyndra and the other renewable energy schemes plus the proposed closure of yucca flats indicates either a misguided policy for additional energy for our economy or a deliberate policy of slowing down our quest for badly needed energy sources past statements and actions indicate to me the latter obama is more interested in his left wing allies than he is in the success of the u s economy
710147732,you've concluded that obama is handicapping our economy intentionally i presume by slowing our quest for energy how would increasing our quest for energy translate into success for the economy also if what you say is true about energy sources being badly needed wouldn't the economy be roaring along right about now considering that production in almost every type of energy field is up considerably as compared to or years ago lastly if obama was more interested in me left wing ally than the economy production for oil natural gas and coal wouldn't be at record setting paces now would it
710147732,i consider myself a moderate but i'm sure most people out there do truth be told most others would identify me as a liberal and i generally think obama is doing a pretty good job and that most of the criticism he receives are irrational rants however on this one i think he screwed up nevada and environmental groups make a few good points there is risk in having a nuclear waste storage facility in yucca mountain there is risk in transportation but the arguments used compare apples to oranges the argument usually goes like this the nrc says the facility won't keep us safe for well forever therefore we should continue storing waste on site at reactors because that's perfectly safe for at least the next couple of decades until we can figure out a long term solution nuclear waste storage has attendant risks no doubt about it arguing that potential hazards with small but not precisely quantifiable risks storage in yucca mountain should be passed up in favor of a short term solution with larger more readily quantifiable risks together with some other risk that we have undoubtedly failed to anticipate storage on site is like refusing to wear seatbelts because you aren't sure if they'll come off if you drive into a lake only about times dumber still let's address some other issues the water table yes within geological timescales there used to be water there that could be a concern except that over geological timescales the waste will be dramatically less dangerous even if the water table rose by tens of meters pretty dramatic it would still be well below the level of the facility earthquakes yes nevada is near some faults so are nuclear power facilities across the country moving spent fuel to yucca mountain is putting all our eggs in one basket but that basket is deep underground in as geologically stable an area as we know away from much larger population centers than las vegas pretty good basket future waste sure we will use up the space in yucca mountain immediately but the payoff is that tons of waste will no longer be stored at myriad nuclear sites it will take about years at present rates to generate the same amount of waste again in that time perhaps we can expand the yucca mountain facility or find some other location for burial recycling i'd love it if we could reprocess nuclear waste away i think the very idea is awesome and it makes a lot of sense unfortunately there are technical complications and proliferation risks moreover even with extensive reprocessing there will always be waste that must eventually just be stored this is an area that should be worked on over the next few decades putting off the storage issue is not radiation the nrc said it was okay for the facility to increase a person's annual exposure by about best estimates put the increase in annual exposure at less than one extra banana a week will kill you faster and that's after years when the facility isn't in top shape anymore we're a society that can't figure out that healthcare costs have long term consequences we're a society that can't bear the thought of changing our transportation paradigm to reduce carbon emissions even though the consequences are likely scant decades away why on this storage issue are we suddenly so squeamish upset that the facility might not have integrity in splajillion years even though it will probably be fine even then there've been claims that the choice of yucca mountain was a purely political one without science the fact is that opponents of the yucca mountain site are grasping at scientific uncertainties to play their own political game and undermining what might be the most sound decision ever to come out of the nrc let's not throw away a real opportunity to minimize risk just because it doesn't eliminate risk to the guy who mentioned patent number wow either you got your number wrong or you're seriously confused how do you intend to use an air brake to treat nuclear waste also re solyndra accusing that funding of being unethical would be like saying that subsidies for natural gas exploration were unethical because natural gas prices have dropped significantly solyndra was a reasonable investment in a market that became rapidly more price competitive you break eggs to make an omelet
710202837,cuts are coming it is not political it is simply economic reality
710202837,whatever happened to we can't wait
710202837,maybe ed rendell is right obama is a major wussy
710202837,how can a president whose budgets for the last three years did not get one single vote from either party in either house of congress veto a major spending bill with such overwhelming bipartisan support i hope he does veto it and they get the votes to override the veto maybe he'll get the message that he's absolutely totally out of touch with everything
710202837,when is the last time you had a raise my health insurance just went up so any increase in pay i get surely won't offset that increase given i'm self employed i surely can't pass that increase on to my clients i'll have to work more hours to generate more billable dollars what a novel idea working to take care of your family
710202837,the gop congress were told by we the people the president sent them the american jobs act they said no congrats this is their obstructionism in action tank the economy hurt americans then blame the president we will remember
710202837,i am extremely disappointed that republicans are asking federal employees to take a freeze in pay for a third year in a row the economy has been sh t why would we hand out raises what planet are these people on when all of the private sector gets a raise then we will give the public sector a raise why should my money pay for your raise when i didn't get a raise myself i have great job i get raises based on performance or getting a higher job position we get bonuses based on how profitable the company is no profit no bonus we control our own fate these idiotic raises need to stop
710202837,if i had a dog he would look like cisco
710202837,screw the gvt workers the slackers need to pay more into their benefits so we pay less in taxes
710202837,one of the largest cost savers is the davis bacon act that is maintained special for the unions mucho could be saved by killing this in all government contracts
710202837,much as i agree that the gop has welched on their deal to limit spending i don't think obama should veto any bill that comes along with such high support just out of spite
710202837,obama won't have to the dems will simply shelve it in the senate
710202837,this is a totally lame argument obama had every chance in the world when the dems controlled everything for two years all they had to do was introduce a bill that get the support of one of the two liberal women from maine in the senate the voters sent the house dems packing because they didn't want legislation done the way the dems were doing it they didn't want the jobs act of obama they want legislation that will actually help the private sector create jobs and the current adminstration seems clueless
710211449,the union thugs are going to lose thank the lord walker is the best of us gang
710211449,union leaders so in touch with workers they represent it pays to be a union boss first class travel six figure salaries for half the officers and staffers plenty of plum jobs for family members life is good at the top of the international brotherhood of boilermakers iron ship builders blacksmiths forgers and helpers the union with its headquarters in kansas city kan represents about workers in the u s and canada who make and repair boilers fit pipes and work on ships and power plants the recession has hit their trade hard reducing union membership at the same time the president s salary has surged percent in the past six years not counting a recent raise add in travel and some other expenses and newton b jones received more than last year putting him at the absolute top of the presidents of the dozen biggest unions in the country many relatives of union officers also ride the payroll totaling the pay to just the families of jones and two other executives the union and its affiliates gave them more than million in annual salary according to the most recent financial reports filed by the organizations
710211449,union leaders have pizzed away their members funds and now they want more feom the liberals too funny hey you union members how do you like them leaders now they are exactly like obama knish love to spend other peoples money
710211449,the union thug are whiny crybabies hahahahahahahahaha

710211449,the thugs are getting worried when the recall fails what amount of damage will the thugs cause when they go on their destructive rampages rampages that could be stopped by passing legislation to punish union violence
710211449,let the blame game begin as the wisconsin unions blame the dnc for the loss bill clinton claims he was called in too late to help though he couldnt help hillary in and he and obama couldnt help reyes on tuesday and obama hides from the media while axelrod tries to claim it doesn't mean anything
710211449,c'mon democrats you need to put up some money to support all those fat and lazy union guys they need longer vacations and coffee breaks you already know how hard they all work and how much more they deserve than the rest of us
710211449,joe registered voter polls are meaningless likely voter polls are the ones you should concentrate on those tell a story of state that will stay up late the first tuesday in november too close to call right now
710211449,unions kill jobs we are a right to work state and our unemployment is the unemployment in wisconsin has dropped since walker took over unions only look out for the higher ups not those they represent
710211449,union leaders have led their members to the point of no return judging from the number of those members opting out karma is a b tch all this wailing gnashing of teeth and finger pointing could bode well for wi
710211449,sounds more like a euology than a rallying cry
710211449,video shows bus treads on the union boss' face
710211449,walker is a great american
710211449,public sector union head says dems could do more for wisconsin recall translation get the thugs out to assure that taxpayers continue to fund all union pay benefits retirement and healthcare screw everyone else it's all about us the public sector unions
710211449,public sector union head says dems could do more for wisconsin recall translation get the thugs out to assure that taxpayers continue to fund all union pay benefits retirement and healthcare screw everyone else it's all about us the public sector unions
710211449,the only folks that don't like scott walker in wisconsin are the unions he has turned a deficit into a surplus in record time the democrats haven't done more because they know that the recall is a waste of time and money scott walker will win the recall in a landslide go scott
710211449,obama is in bearly every state around wi today speaks volumes he won't touch down in the land of cheese didnt he famously say he'd walk the line with big labor
710211449,average duration of unemplyment now at weeks
710211449,maybe the dnc thinks the fix is already in
710211449,hopefully the lead is big enough the rats can't overcome with fraud
710211449,unions should realize that the obama administration has not really gone all out for unions in a matter of fact obama and co has been anti union in many cases the kestone pipeline is just one example but the san francisco oakland bridge outsourcing to china is another the replacement of the eastern span of the san francisco oakland bay bridge where steel fabrication was outsourced to china the project has suffered cost overruns delays and the need to remake some of the steel bridge parts perhaps the work would have proceeded smoothly and on time if the pieces were fabricated here instead of overseas the cost overruns and delays largely are connected to the design of the iconic single suspension tower we must live with and pay for our choices
710211449,one percenters
710211449,we must live with and pay for our choices that is why americans need to make a solemn vow to never ever again vote for a liberal socialist progressive eco scammer leftist or democrat
710211449,the national democrats are not in this fight the republicans are they understand that if they lose this election it will be amplified across the nation prez hussein ego is keeping him from helping the voters in wisconsin to win this election either he is with us or he is against us it looks like that he is against the working people in wisconsin he talks the talk while his walk the walkis looking backward
710211449,if wahtshername bad hair and others are playing this down is means that they know that their guy is gonna lose and it will make a difference clinton can't make any difference he should stay out of there if he wants to keep any semblence of credibility
710211449,the maggot is staying away because everything that he has touched so far has turned to mud he doesn't want his loser name attached to a loser cause i can't wait to see the response on the left when they get beaten but wi republicans get out there and vote the left is bussing folks
710211449,afscme all sponges mooching every taxpayer dollar they can
710211449,no way should any state county city have a union against the people slackers at best
710211449,public sector unions should all be outlawed
710211449,polls have been tight in wisconsin with walker often talking a slight lead against barrett this statement is false walker has always held a substantial lead well more than the margin of error
710211449,with this kind of conflict between the state democrat party and the national democrat party one has to wonder if the national party's refusal to help in the recall election is going to swing the state to romney in november if obama won't help them now will they help him in november
710211449,ju st as judy expl ained i cant bel ieve th at any b ody able to pr ofit in wee ks on the in ternet did you see th is w eb li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710211449,maybe just maybe there realize all is lost in wisconsin and more effort will produce nothing the more they call attention to wisconsin if they lose the recall vote it is a huge defeat for the democrats and for organized labor around the country for the union it is do or die democrats want to survive to fight another day
710211449,look at all states under union stranglehold california new york illinois most of new england economic basketcases and the cost of living is outrageous right to work right to choose to join or not join without the fear of being fired is an american right forced unionization is anti american more socialistic communistic
710211449,right on proof of biased journalism the same lead for obama in the state is substantial but for walker is is slight there is going to be a pounding coming and the unions are are going to have to spin their poor performance union membership is falling hard now that people are not forced to have dues removed from paychecks without choice this choice alone proves the dislike for unions from its own membership i just hope the right can help spin this against obama and make this state more purple if not red they have to deal with the same things pa and oh deal with failing leftist cities voting for obama but most of hte state itself wants a republican battle of rural suburban against inner city
710211449,you shouldn't confuse ruler obama with the democrat party ruler obama announced he was going it alone back in january democrats across the usa you are on your own what would a thug dictator wannabe do or say differently than our ruler obama
710211449,i understand bill clinton is going to wi after his recent defense of mitt romney's corporate raiding though i don't know if clinton is going to be campaigning for barrett or walker
710211449,all the democrats shrieking about how they're going to 'take back' the country starting with wi lmao losers we're tired of your fascism and your failed socialist schemes
710211449,obama is leading the democrats and the union leaders down the path of no return americans are sick of politicans like obama that never held a real job and union leaders that have governed by fear all their life guess what union members are just like the hard working middle class and are sick of the lies of union leaders and obama schumer reid politicans their days are numbered just like the horse and carriage was in america wants real leadership jobs with meanings and stop the welfare handouts which does nothing but degrates humans how do those teachers feel that are confined to rooms and don't teach because they aren't qualified but get paid in ny just one example of crap being force on taxpayers life is real not a life of lies like obama has lived god bless wisconsin and america as we take back out country
710211449,that would be union leaders
710211449,color it gone nov th is a new day in the life of america
710211449,wisconsin union leaders should take note at what democrats in illinois are doing to all public employee unions wages pensions healthcare all being assaulted by the exact people who you funnel union members dues to with friends like that your members will be watching you very closely waiting for next union election yes change has come
710211449,dems could do more like offer cement shoes to those that support walker
710211449,when are you union members going to learn that only when you are useful to his majesty like when he needs your votes in november will be deign to come to your state and tell you all the wonderful things he will do for you in his nd term when he has more flexibility you saps are soooo sad
710211449,not to mention weekly jobless claims revised upward for of past weeks
710211449,told you before to go away now do it
710211449,wow great work
710211449,i hope scott walker wins the unions have ruined this country and anybody that doesn't think so need only look at the detroit auto industry a vote for scott walker is a vote to save wisconsin and the hard working people of that great state
710211449,the clintons do not like the obozos
710211449,that's the stuff bigger and better connections between the labor movement and the progressives yes that's just what's needed 'look for the union label' and in the meantime everyone else is going to starve big labor and the american progressive movement is dissolving before our very eyes ain't collectivism grand
710211449,this is insanity
710211449,as fra ncisco exp lained i did n't even kn ow that any one able to earn in a few w eeks on the inter net have you se en th is p age c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710211449,obama endorsed barrett well duh congratulations you endorsed a fellow democrat way to walk out on that limb but what else has he done spoken publicly about it nope fundraised for him nope come to the state nope campaigned for him nope why would any self respecting democrat support him in november abandon us we abandon you
710211449,unions have already ruined this country at one time was a little help now it has ruined so many states why are all the new car manufactures going to right to worke states tells a big story
710211449,gerry mcentee take your corrupted union and shove it decades ago the union was a good thing but now it is nothing but corruption i can't understand why union workers can't see what the union is doing they take your union dues and do whatever they want with it when in fact they could be putting it towards your medical and retirement why is it the american taxpayers job to do so no one pays ours what makes you people think your so special americans have enough of their tax dollar going to welfare medicaid and every other entitlement then we have to cover your sorry arses don't any of you have consciences or are you so use to that entitlement that nothing else matters doesn't it make you feel like a welfare recipient
710211449,yeah the auto industries that have taken their bulding of cars off of american soil i heard a gm ceo say that of their cars are ade ouside of this country shame on them shame on our government who over regulates or taxes businesses so much that they leave america i hope mitt romney can chnge that and those businesses will come back to america
710211449,it has to be all about him or he doesn't care he has dumped on union members from the beginning did he give them card check no did he stand up for them and build the pipeline no it would have made the enviro woosies mad unless it is about obama it doesn't count now line up like good libs and vote for him in november he expects it and as king he can command it
710211449,public sector unions have the power to do more for wisconsin and the nation than any other person or organization they could disband the steep decline in educational standards can be traced to the unionization of teachers similar declines in quality in other work areas can be effectively addressed by eliminating the unions that protect deadbeats and slackers and do nothing for hard working employees except raid their paychecks
710211449,they could have told the truth about the damage the unions have done to the state with a plan to fix it besides raising taxes
710211449,the unions are just like your supposed 'ers they want it all their own way so they can tell you what to do and both sides are stealing this country they are part of the criminal element of wisconsin and if they are not kept in check you will be a union dues payer whether you like it or not afscme is as bad as all the rest if obama gets another term it will be all over folks
710211449,unions are wasting thier money even if walker loses the budget is set for two years they still would not control enough of the state government to change article
710211449,mcentee needs a waaaaaaa mbulance
710211449,still pretending to be women jack white
710211449,could have done more the unions have done everything they can just last weekend they were out at the cemeteries around the state collecting signatures for absentee ballots what more can you ask
710211449,is this the problem with american society no it is the union's problem a public uion does not represent every one of us in america
710512988,herr axel's head must be exploding old bill is just starting to get even over obama's smearing his wife
710512988,and threatening their daughter
710512988,lol slick william telling the truth good start to recovery
710512988,subtle bigotry good job you obama troll now go back to herr axel and tell him you've been outed
710512988,he said a man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold clinton is one person the obama campaign won't be able to convince to walk back the comments
710512988,i've read that but doubt it ever happened but obama as president could have access to a lot of things on any part of the family that the clinton's would prefer not to be known doubt that would be unusual in politics
710512988,true but clinton's dossier on obama would sink oman in a nanosecond rememeber he infiltrated lots of departments over his years
710512988,jobs number will disappoint again prepare for the wh spin
710512988,even clinton knows the truth and obama carney and axelrod continue to engage in class warfare and attack small business and capitalism this is going to backfire big time i can just see romney cutting commercials with clinton defending bain give it up obama we dont want socialism to replace capitalism you are the one who is out of touch
710512988,harry reid is a mormon
710512988,i can spot these obama trolls a mile away typically a kid living in his parent's basement with a che poster hanging over his workstation
710512988,good for you herr axel has an army of these slackers posting scare crap like this all the time
710512988,opps another high profile liberal democrat speaking the truth as opposed to the business hating free enterprise loathing mister obama
710512988,good to see good ole untrustworthy bill clinton doing pro romney work all the more reason for the wh to continue the bain romney attacks
710512988,yes the unemployment numbers will probably be about soon what a freaking joke this wh has become
710512988,u number ay total unemployed plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force plus total employed part time for economic reasons as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force
710512988,my thoughts exactly clinton's revenge over the dirty tactics against hillary by obama is just beginning it will be subtle but effective old political wounds never heal and the community organizer is about to find that out
710512988,the only unqualified candidate is the failed incumbent go back on the golf links barry where are the jobs mr president got solyndra
710512988,some economists are putting it as high as what ever the figure i don't think is true for instance several economists have said it takes putting back to work to lower it then one week they announced jobs for and it went down
710512988,so you are in favor of a socialistic government
710512988,oh yeah many dems have been backing away at a high rate of speed
710512988,bill clinton should keep his big mouth shut when it comes to this election he's still smarting over the fact that his sort of wife didn't get the nomination that was a very good thing because to have those back in the white house would be moral disaster for this country
710512988,funny how that works isn't it
710512988,it did come from an insider that had access to the info but the whole behind the scenes during the last election smells hillary is leading and leading and suddenly she pulls out she wanted that job bad it doesn't add up
710512988,bill clinton should keep his big mouth shut when it comes to this election he's still smarting over the fact that his sort of wife didn't get the nomination that was a very good thing because to have those back in the white house would be moral disaster for this country don't forget the racist remarks hillhillary made about the white boys are going to vote for her in pa also bill's remark about jesse jackson and the comparison to obama their behbehavior was a disgrace
710512988,what are you talking about
710512988,few things remind us of how things have gone wrong like a bill clinton eruption to go back to traditional america we have to send back the baggage of liberal america
710512988,seems to like the bus tossing is coming obama's way i guess what comes around goes around at least he won't be alone under that bus he has tossed the better part of the nation under there but really what else can clinton say when obama ran and every claimed his credentials were acceptable it lowered the bar to where a foreign born anti american socialist dog catcher is perfectly qualified now but if you will notice they are all forcing obama off his attack business as the primary evil main argument which means that is dawning on some of them that they jumped the shark which leaves obama much less to demonize romney with he will have lots of trouble going after his religion and romney has fewer character flaws than obama so it is like they are forcing him to run on his accomplishments and a lot of those are quite unpopular i have never seen a race when the incumbents arguments are being so undermined by his own surrogates this definitely looks like they are turning on him without openly coming out and saying that they are turning on him
710512988,but of course you see rounds up to then rounds up to see how that works
710512988,bill clinton presided over a booming economy low unemployment and a prosperous america bush being the turnaround specialist he is turned all of that into disaster clinton left office with the highest approval of any president bush was at worry about your own morals
710512988,back a little over a year ago when mr obama turned the white house press conference over to bill clinton so mr obama and his wife could leave town i knew this man was not right for this job
710512988,he taught young people about oral sex long before they needed to know especially from their president he was a disgrace and can't be respected everything he does is to feather his own nest
710512988,iromney is an out of touch multi millionaire that has never had to experience the true struggles of daily american life in his entire privileged existence mitt may try to cover his platinum soul but his taxes and his record at bain offer great insight into his character and background bain was a profit making venture for mitt bain and the other well heeled investors romney took on it had nothing to with creating jobs how can romney profess to fix a jobs crisis when all he knows is how to kill jobs and make himself richer www sunstateactivist org
710512988,translation if obama wins i'll never get back in the white house hillary in clinton loves throwing obama under the bus keep up the good work
710512988,anti business rhetoric makes me like romney even more class envy is unappealing women for romney
710512988,clinton has been obama is almost finished
710512988,every business on the planet is a profit making venture it's the reason they exist as for romney's qualifications i'll refer you to the ex president see above
710512988,obama showed his leadership when he let bill speak unattended and unsupervised at the white house podium for twnenty minutes it was surreal bill clinton is nothing but a has been
710512988,clinton was helped along by a conservative congress forcing him to the right of course let's all forget about his perjury and his frolics with the intern let's hope for change in november

710512988,we don't want to go backwards to the bad old days of some mythical traditional america you fantasize about
710512988,herr axel and who's a child living in their parent's basement grow up sonny you might find you like it oh and you are not gonna like november one little bit lmao

710512988,that's right go vote against you're own interests as a woman that's why there still isn't a woman president in a country that's over years old equal pay for equal work i guess that's not important to you either

710512988,hey flop i can't recall you saying the same for ted kennedy jay rockerfeller and john kerry
710512988,but clinton's not endorsing romney he's endorsing obama he said favorable things about mccain's qualifications also in and about dole in whom he beat by a landsllide watch to see what else he says in the coming months about romney he won't have to walk back his comments it will be all about romney's failed tenure as governor
710512988,you are so incredibly clueless and juvenile to make comments like that got nothing intelligent to say
710512988,that's president barack solyndra obama for now and the foreseeable future get used to it already
710512988,he doesn't know anything about anything he says nothing better to do than lie and make juvenile insults

710512988,the review for the funding started under bush but they did not make the decision to give the money to solybdra in fact they recommended to not give the loan when are you dem's going to admit your mistakes and quit blaming bush for everything
710512988,i think it's not a question about whether romney is qualified to run for president the issue is does his business experience qualify him to be a good president i think the answer is no more comments on my blog barley literate by rick
710512988,the america you loved was headed for the biggest financial crisis since the great depression before obama started and is now firmly on a path to recovery job numbers steadily increasing unemployment decreasing lower tax rate than ever in the last years and lower spending than any administration since before ronald reagan the america you loved sent over american soldiers to die for a lie the america you loved institutionalized discrimination against women gays and minorities the america you loved is long gone you'll never get the chance to live in romney's amercia
710512988,misogyny and ignorance on full display from the left women working in the obama wh actually make less than their male counterparts women for romney
710512988,huge miss on jobs v k expected game over for o
710512988,did you see today's jobs number care to revise that statement about a firm recovery
710512988,have you noticed how many dems have strayed from the bain capital topic as a campaign topic point that's because even obama's campaign can't skew the numbers in their favor most americans are far too educated and smart for this peter pan playhouse ridiculous nonsense attacking bain capital only strengthens romney's position
710512988,denigration of women from the left is not wise explains why independent women are moving away from obama romney
710512988,anyone with common sense knows ob is desperate since his record is so horrible but he dems are trying to tell him he is nuts to attack private businesses
710512988,take back the america we loved a white guy in the white house
710512988,but ob's experience as a community organizer and someone who never ran anything or met a payroll qualified him your blog must be comedy
710512988,ummmmm no it didn't approved in against the recommendations of the gwb administration educate yourself you seem dim
710512988,romney and bain are considered rock stars in the private equity world obama time and time again displays his absolute ignorance when it comes to business and the free enterprise system obama has pretended to be a venture capitalist with taxpayers money and he has lost romney batted while at bain and the net result was the creation of tens of thousands of jobs and the healthy portfolios of thousands of k's and pension plans
710512988,foreseeable future ends in months apparently get used to that
710512988,but ob knew those struggles pass what you are smoking we do love laughing at you lunacy though so keep it up educate yourself then try to get a job
710512988,no hostage tape forthcoming for him

710512988,ha ha lol
710512988,bill is a master on politics the clintons beat the gop in and and on impeachment president obama beat them for the democratic nomination and now all three of them will be working together to beat romney any of you who doubt his five or six points prediction go to intrade and bet for romney the shares are cheap now and you'll clean up come november if you really doubt bill clinton
710512988,he is just an uneducated liberal lemming parroting the lies he is being spoon fed on some freebagger blog it is actually shocking how many people are that dumb
710512988,check your facts better romney left massachusetts with a billion budget deficit around million in new taxes and fees and a th place finish in job creation his approval rating towards the end of his term at percent in november ranked th of the u s governors
710512988,see that horrible jobs number
710512988,what recovery jobless numbers continue to increase as total employed number shrinks to the lowest level in our lifetimes jan the tax rates will increase on everyone as the bush tax cuts expire the democrats in the senate and house voted overwhelmingly for the war in iraq using the same intel as the administration your world would be a better place with saddam hussein in power explain the institutionalized discrimination you are talking about the and th amendments dealt with those issues even with strong democrat party resistance the republican party passed them facts are stubborn things for useful idiots
710512988,look at what it was at the end of w's administration compared to now it was negative now it's positive
710512988,since bill and ob are the only two dem presidents since i'm pretty sure the country is smarter than to do it again how did you bet in nov when the liberals took a historic beating same thing on the way especially when wlaker wins huge tuesday after all of the libs and union whining
710512988,what was that number then and now
710512988,why would i want to go to your blog when you think that the fiscal disaster obama with no business experience is better at running the country than a man with private sector and executive experience
710512988,only below the expected number lmao months in a row ue over which ob told us would never go above if he was able to waste a trillion bucks another huge failure
710512988,u up to
710512988,the clintons do not think much of the obozos mr and mrs obozo are not high on their respected list
710512988,got those numbers
710512988,that's the new line of attack this week this like all the rest will also go down in flames see war on women dog story his religion bain etc mitt's record as governor was sterling romney balanced every budget obama has not romney inherited a deficit too and fixed it obama did not romney left office with a billion dollar surplus obama has added trillion dollars and counting in new debt romney brought down the un employment rate obama has not romney never blamed his predessor for mass debt he went to work and fixed the problem obama is still whining it's bush's fault after years of him at the helm romney's policies created full employment in mass that's why the phony stat of th in job creation is so deceptive obama's real unemployment stat is because people have dropped out of the job market altogether and are not calculated in the rate anymore oh yea mitt is more than happy to compare his record as ceo of mass to obama's joke of leadership
710512988,that's right then four more years for a second term
710512988,are you dumb enough to think that bill wants obama re elected he is still holding a grudge about ' and will continue to casually undermine the man who accused him of racism
710512988,this has to be driving the obama gang nuts the minute they put out a commercial criticizing bain romney's campaign can counter with ads featuring bill clinton and other prominent democrats supporting romney's record at bain talk about having your legs cut out from under you sorry libs this time we won't be underfunded you had your four years to mess things up but come january we start rebuilding from the rubble you've left this country in now even some of your big guns are helping us your guy can't even keep other prominent democrats in line what's up with that
710512988,where are your numbers supporting your statement
710512988,obozo has spent his entire life sponging off the taxpayers what would he know about business
710512988,in defiance of the supreme court and their ruling last year that demanding i d to vote is totally legal eric holder has told florida he will not allow them to take non citizens registered to vote off of the voting rolls he will not allow dhs to share information as to whether they have been deported or not boehner and the other republican elites continue playing footsie with him and clinton is right teamobama will win one way or another
710512988,holder would not spit on michael steele like thiis he knows the rich frat boys running the rnc and the republican party and their loyal step and fetch its like boehner and mcconnel won't cross him it might make the new york times mad danger danger and the fool republicans just extended the voting rights act which holder has grabbed to assert his dictatorial powers danger danger this is the moment
710512988,bill is right bill like romney was actually a ceo of a state before he became president he get's it obama is the most unqualified man to ever occupy the white house bar none community organizer and it shows
710512988,well yeah the hatred toward business is just plain stupid and pres clinton knows it as he was at least willing to work w biz but have to laugh at biden saying neither a private equity guy or a plumber should be prez well we'll see how far it gets him geez where do the dems think their tax money comes from oh wait that's right they're printing money like crazy making it absolutely worthless paper
710512988,with unemployment how many jobs can be created k jobs created and rate up to as of this morning the expected number was k this administration and president are more worried about abortion gay marriage and an unconstitutional healthcare mandate than real issues
710512988,clinton signed nafta to send millions of jobs overseas why would we expect him to do anything but defend another job destroyer
710512988,slick william telling the truth causes suspicion maybe he is laying some kind of trap
710512988,president drone murderer or president downgrade which do you think obama will be forever remembered the american civil liberties union believes obama will forever be remembered for signing the power of the potus to use usa military forces to indefinitely detain usa citizens without notice trial or charges we have an alien in the white house
710512988,poor obuma can't let bill go he only has two surrogates biden clinton to campaign for him just like with congress obama doesn't work well with others so doesn't have a support team
710512988,come january we start rebuilding from the rubble you've left this country in that would be like the nazis showing up in berlin saying we're here to pick up where we left off
710512988,timothy geithner remains the ceo of the federal financing bank obama's treasury secretary geithner opened the vault doors for the obama green energy looters and thieves obama corzine transparent bankrupt obama rules looters rule
710512988,obama knows how to bankrupt companies
710512988,attacking usa capitalism is obama's priority and mission good thing obama is almost finished
710512988,keep dreaming libs your azz is done go back and teach for that is all you know other than signup blacks for welfare gtfo
710512988,bwahahaha the clintons have never liked the poser in chief
710512988,joe how's those improving economy links you've been using consumer confidence still rising
710512988,numbers please
710512988,that was my first thought
710512988,wow sabotage at its worst obama should just quit no one wants him to win too many wall street puppets in the dems clinton lol
710512988,we got a lying president and one who cannot run on his record so he is using all he can to distract voters from the real issues facing america today even his wife mrs obama calls the president a lair i wonder how his daughters feel a lying daddy and husband one where the parents agrue every night and sleep in differnt bedrooms apart from each other all the photo ops and smiles together along with te kids are so fake
710512988,he's obviously racist romney
710512988,no doubt about it republican obstruction and obfuscation has devastated our economy and threatens to destroy the very fabric of america
710512988,bill clinton knows a none issue when he sees it he also sees how romney can counterattack against the bain charges with solyndra he knows this is a losing argument for the president here's hoping obama is so arrogant that he refuses to listen to clinton
710512988,you are wrong bill clinton is a sleaze and always was
710512988,sounds correct to me
710512988,and the clintons are not high on the country's respect list either
710512988,you are wrong
710512988,ju st as ch ris exp lained i'm su rprised that you can pro fit in o ne m onth on the comp uter have you rea d this l ink c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710512988,you mean make you work
710512988,joe steel in head where are yoour usual set of rosy links
710512988,clinton can't stand the fact that he is an ex president and uses every opportunity he can to pontificate he has not gotten over the fact that his sort of wife didn't get the nomination
710512988,job numbers are currently at a net positive even if only barely unique to this recovery unlike say the recovery sparked during ronald satan's um i mean reagan's presidency is that this president has not relied on creating public sector government jobs to buoy the recovery in fact obama has continued to cut government public jobs and this government i hate the notion of giving the potus all the credit blame has ultimately created far more private sector jobs en route to netting positive employment gains for a much larger population facing much starker challenges with regards to outsourcing manufacturing automation etc than in any other historical instance where the economy has been in such disrepair
710512988,there are seas between us and mexico or us and canada you have no idea what you are talking about nafta has evened the playing field for the us if you knew what you were talking about you would know that we already had a free trade agreement with canada and that mexico was enjoying gsp benefits which meant that they didn't pay duty coming here but we paid lots going there we weren't able to bid on contracts there but they could come here now it goes both ways the agreement has nothing to do with jobs going overseas you should study before you right i am certainly no fan of the current president and i liked clinton even less but you need to have your facts straight or you just look like a fool
710512988,let me give you a lesson in business my husband and i started a busines when bush was in office it was going pretty good hard work hour days days a week no vacation pay or sick pay but we were growing and reaching the american dream oblamer comes along here is a lis to what we pay now with oblamer and the dems in charge the first year he was in office and added to our taxes federal unemployment taxes state unemployment taxes both up dramatically because of the unemployment spikes job and family services welfare which is a percentage of what we pay our employees workmens compensation money to a company to handled workmens comp claims even though we have never used workmems comp cat tax commecial activity tax that is progressive with the amount your business makes we have to match all medicare and social security payments of every employee my husband and i are double tapped for social security and medicare because we are self employed real estate taxes on the business hazardous waste removal taxes city taxes state taxes school taxes that is just the business taxes then we have to pay all the personal taxes like everyone else like federal staxes state taxes city taxes school taxes and real estate taxes on our home once oblamercare kicks in we will have to close the doors as we will not be able to afford to keep the doors open that is what oblamer has done to our business we are a small business multiple that times all the businesses across the nation and maybe if you stop thinking with our butt you will get why unemployment is skyrocketing and anyone with a business sense knows that oblamer is poison to this economy
710512988,you are clueless the dems had control of the entire congress first years what was the excuse then
710512988,nancianne if you read my comment it had nothing to do with approval of clinton's behavior i personally think he is a dishonest opportunist who will do or say anything to remain in power but i still say he is out for revenge against obama no doubt about it this doesn't negate the accuracy of his comments about mit romney's qualifications
710512988,you are delusional under obama's years highest national debt in us history deficit spending balooned more than all previous us presidents combined unemployment above for three straight years currently vorrowing cents of every federal dollar spent st ever downgrade of us economy this man is a business hating disaster
710512988,jamie ease up on old joe he has a head of solid steel nothing permates that skull
710512988,good post
710512988,yes look at that three million fewer americans are employed now than when bush left office when bush left office unemployment was
710512988,obama for the forseeable future it will be obama until nov when the community organizer will be booted out of the office that he was never qualified for to begin with
710512988,charles did you look at the job figures released today before you wrote your coments as the saying goes everyone is entitled to their own opinion but there is only one set of facts your opinion is not based on the facts
710512988,great and insightful comment bruce on the mark
710512988,nice race card play go to time out idiot
710512988,completely wrong the bush administration refused to fund solyndra and the first conditional commitment to fund was made on march your socialist friend obama pushed through the funding in spite of objections on sep and held a big press show on the th you lose come out into the light and prosper
710512988,every day of the week and twice on sunday my interests don't have anything to do with killing babies or expecting the government to pay for me to have sex they do however extend to equal pay which if you look you will find the dems are not for just look at their own staff where they pay women on average less than male staffers they put their money where their mouth is and then attack the other side for having a moral compass my moral compass works very well thanks and it is directing me to the polls in november where we can say goodbye to the mess we have today
710512988,unemployment just went up i won't waste time rebutting the other multitude of lies in your post
710512988,i see no evidence that president obama has put a muffler on anyone the rumor mill thrives on suggesting this but with what proof i find it interesting that gov romney hired a campaign staff member and fired him when he found out he was gay if the evidence shows he was incompetent to do the job yes replacement would be in order has anyone seen a evidence that he was terminated for not being able to do the job please don't quote rush limbaugh or faux snooze as evidence it is as much of a turn off to me as rachel maddow is to you on the right
710512988,and even the k jobs will probably be revised lower next month a bunch of children in the wh trying to do an adult job
710512988,i have plenty of self respect certainly i have enough to pay for my own birth control and to know that killing is wrong no matter how small the victim my brainless self makes just under figures so i guess i am doing ok
710512988,schooner like all lib roaches comes out once in a while my approach is to bring as much sunshine to this room as possible through facts libs run when asked for facts to support their outrageous statements
710512988,and our socialist government is why we are failing and going over the cliff get a clue
710512988,i can then agree with you romney appears to be qualified but for clinton to praise him is so obvious dishonest opportunist describes clinton perfectly i think both clintons can be described in that manner
710512988,job numbers steadily increasing lower spending firmly on a path of recovery sounds like everything is great but i doubt it
710512988,uh huh i can't wait until they go there now that bain attack has backfired hugely i guess once that backfires he may have to run on his record like a good incumbent would or not
710512988,however if mitt is promoting his bain experience then tell the entire story not just the positive spin let the whole truth be understood
710512988,oh but obama has the women's vote because they are soooo respectful toward women sam is an example of their illiterate and dumb voters romney
710512988,i will take billion over any day
710512988,amen jamie let's vote the dem hypocrites out in nov
710512988,bill clinton was a lot more successful than your farce of a president that occupies the office now he understood how to triangulate which is a foreign concept to the marxist in chief
710512988,unemployment moved up to today created far more private sector jobs where solyndra
710512988,oh dem hacks like schooner can't let facts get in the way of their stupid inaccurate rhetoric
710512988,what underground newspapers are you reading
710512988,what a credible story added to our taxes federal unemployment taxes state unemployment taxes both up dramatically because of the unemployment spikes quite credible
710512988,oh what's a little oral sex in the oval office with a wh intern to dems they think that is an advantage to a cnadidate bill clinton's immorality was despicable but the dems think he is their idea of cool
710512988,lmao now who is the kid using internet slang grow up son
710512988,beware of kind words from wolves beware of the lets be friends talk and then have a knife show up in your back this is called chucago politics
710512988,now you are blaming kenstarr for the perversion that took place in the clinton wh you dems can never take responsibility for anything it is always the fault of george bush ken starr ronald reagan no wonder we have turned into a nation of deadbeats who always put the blame on someone else thanks to the democratic party
710512988,no we are not going to like nov one little bit sam we are going to love it a lot when your incompetent bho loses
710512988,only the most hateful racists of the retro crowd feel that way darnay unfortunately here they have a free reign to spit their venom like a king cobra i have a problem wondering what was so great about the good old days i think they were rather rotten as i rapidly approach my th year thru diet exercise and meditation i am healthier and happier than i have ever been that is except for being disabled which i can live with i see our country going more towards not being big brother and jumping into wars willy nilly our cars more fuel efficient not in denial of global warming cleaner air and water healthier foods better techniques in criminal investigations thru new technology and a future when civil rights will be extended to all people setting an example as a true leader of the free world why are these things bad things do we have our problems of course can we solve them yes by all of us working together both sides of the aisle the retros abhor that idea as evidenced by their posting here but they may sit on their front porches mumbling at the skateboarders drivers kids playing and everything else blaming them on making their life miserable but that is the way with old people too often and i see with us facing problems head on and working towards solutions i can say god has truly blessed america
710512988,clinton as president wanted to reduce social security and if he had succeeded people receiving ss today would be receiving less in their paycheck the age qualification would have been increased even more than it is and overall ss would have been reduced by i think the real bill clinton is starting to show up and fyi clinton complimented ryan and quote said to him you succeeded on getting the ball rolling on his social security campaign
710512988,what job increase unemployment decreasing what did you see the numbers today please
710512988,et tu brutus obama betrayed by so called allies ford booker patrick and clinton all private equity guys for a mess of soup duvall is beholden to equity firms that heavily fund his campaign this is the corrupting influence of money his greater loyalty is to wall street than his friend this man is selling out in many fronts selling out to betray not just obama but all the people that bain cruelly mistreated and discarded like used toilet papers there may be another factor at play here jealousy then another factor blacks routinely undermining their own joe rickett plan against obama using rev wright as the peg recently talked about deploying articulate blacks to undermine the president gov scott walker in a broader context characterized his own approach as divide and conquer amazing democrats should primary patrick in massachusetts next time around while republicans are rally around romney democrats remain undisciplined and rogue and many of the office holding democrats betraying obama are former clinton staffers with clinton himself playing a somewhat dubious role even in the face of a serious republican challenge you can t satisfy these folks they are just out for themselves and lack esprit de corp interestingly enough hostile tv appearances by harold ford cory booker duvall patrick all blacks and all private equity guys all seem co ordinated by clinton who finally showed up himself on tv to praise romney s firm and business experience as sterling bill clinton whose son in law works for a private equity company has continued to nurse grudges against obama for his win over hillary in do these folks want a republican in the white house to carry out that party s damaging policies on the poor women elderly disabled vets latinos blacks gays lesbians the middle class religious minorities and the country as a whole here note their militarism their corrupt alliance with the military industrial complex their penchant for blowing the deficit even though they propagandize economic growth look at the mess w left the country and the world in america think
710512988,now bill's agenda becomes clearer get obozo out in so hillary bill has a clear shot at before old hillary is too old to walk to her coronation i like the idea because we get rid of obozo and when romney cleans up the economy he will be unbeatable in ridding us also of the clintons good plan ol boy
710512988,and your implication is that this would have been a bad thing
710512988,you really should spend time on research when bain invested in the steel company in about it was about to close they put money in raised employment and were running well it closed in when steel mills all over the world were closing due to cheap foreign competition had the union workers accepted a lower wage offer bain may have kept it open but it would probably still have closed in light of the low wage foreign competition when you quote cbs news and politifact you are not credible
710512988,i think you drink way too much delusional at best
710512988,please provide the evidence he fired him because he was gay let's start there innocent until proven guilty remember not the other way around
710512988,where are all your talking points today joe oh wait you can't post that drivel anymore lmaooooooooooooooooo hilarious
710512988,god forbid is the moochers actually have to get a job to support themselves
710512988,i hope many log onto our missionary in chief's reference it is well written his mormon faith does effect his stand on civil rights it is not different from those called for with hatred from the churches throughout the bible belt it represents only a small part of why i will not vote for him i believe all people regardless of religion sexual activity between consenting adults race and sex should be treated equally under the law based on the declaration of independence and the preamble to our constitution the main reason i support president obama is unemployment that is the main issue facing us today not the national debt that is a reflection it's really simple the gop believes in austerity to solve our problems unfortunately it has never worked in the past every republican administration tried it the worse being coolidge and hoover bush took the reserve money and gave it back to the rich he comes in rd behind those other two the democrats believe in stimulus give businesses the money and create projects for them around our nation to let them hire people working now buy things someone has to make those things so companies hire and the people they hire buy things and everyone pays taxes i ask are you supporting your candidate obama or romney based on side issues such as doma a woman's right to choose gay rights race religion or the national debt etc or are you basing it on solving our greatest issue unemployment
710512988,billy knows obama is going to lose so he is trying is triangulation move billy we don't want you either
710512988,you are a bigot
710512988,yes but it won't be through obama and a second term it is time to take america back to its greatness and that is not through more unemployment caused by obama and his s fleas it is jobs drill jobs
710512988,you are sick what other gossip you trying to peddle
710512988,the hill ran an article a couple of days ago quoting the staffer himself saying he was not fired for being gay
710512988,are you sure hillary isn't planning to challenge president obama for the democratic nomination
710512988,what you are talking about is progress accomplished by a thinking working free people who keep enough of the fruits of their labor to keep innovating advancing and inventing making all of our lives better that's not government working that's people and civil society coming up with methods and ideas for making life better it's our system the constitutional structure of divided power and the philosophy of limited government that makes america's greatness possible it's people incentivized by the fruits of their own labor to put in an effort it's that which has blessed america freeing human ingenuity and spirit to improve the world i haven't seen any cobra venom being spit out anywhere remember disagreement with liberals isn't evil also i don't think anyone feels these problems can't be overcome they will be with or without the old codgers and their 's era stagflation and redistribution ideas there is a time for every generation to stand aside look at the grad motto of all the graduating classes of the world's not ending we're just taking it over thank god maybe the problem with stimulus is what happens when the stimulus ends government can only give money by taking the money from someone else first it does not have better ideas on efficiently spending that money than the individual who earned it look at alan greenspan's comments on cnbc this morning government spending is the worst most wasteful and unsuccessful way to stimulate the economy known to god and man millions of individuals making their own consumption decisions so that private industry meets their demands efficiently powers the economy and has the added benefit of respecting the dignity of choice for individuals bureaucracy's stimulaters can never replicate that i have great optimism and confidence in america's future and our children will make it even better
710512988,clinton was asked by obama to campaign for him he's getting exactly what he asked for
710512988,wrong the bush administration refused to approve the loan obama owns solyndra
710512988,everyonce in a while lberals will tell the truth and then they have to bite their lip and say they did not really say it even when it it on tape showing them saying it
710512988,there's no question that a man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold bill always appreciated your ability to be a bit more reasonable and centrist though still left of center but me thinks you might be priming the pump ahead of your appearance in wisconsin this weekend to capture those independent minds no
710512988,sec'y of state is forbidden by law from even attending the convention bill tried to get her to resign a few months ago but she refused it's still a long time until the convention so she could resign and be nominated by acclamation in charlotte but if she did she would be dead to the far left maybe she and bill don't care about the far left crazies after all bill was a centrist and she would attract a lot of independents so he doesn't care
710512988,i'm not shocked shocked that president clinton would defend gov romney and his private equity background after all these are the 'folks' that he and his wife are going to hit up for cash when she runs for president right after this election is over
710512988,wh at gl enn sa id i am taken by sur prise that you can make in four weeks on the int ernet ha ve you se en this we bpage c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710512988,the entire media have gotten this bain strategy wrong the obama strategy is playing out perfectly the strategy is to highlight romoney' as a predator vulture capitalist and at the same time have surrogates say very nice things about bain because obama does not want to alienate the vast majority of voters who may be turned off by bashing bain
710512988,i have three questions for bill clinton on this to see whether his assessment is neutral and surely objective does any member of your family work in private equity firm have romney and bain employees made contributions in the past to the clinton global initiative do you mr clinton have any investments in private equity firms including bain capital we need honest and straightforward answers not the usual meandering stuff
710512988,thank you clinton i don't like you but you just made my day it doesn't get any better
710512988,finally a democrat who tells the truth is clinton having his eyes opened also i noticed he has lost quite a bit of weight i wonder if he is okay
710512988,what's your point
710512988,bill may finnally see what a dumbazz looks like he punched odummer in the mouth
710512988,the entire media have gotten this bain strategy wrong the obama strategy is playing out perfectly the strategy is to highlight romoney' as a predator vulture capitalist and at the same time have surrogates say very nice things about bain because obama does not want to alienate the vast majority of voters who may be turned off by bashing bain
710512988,i think that the way clinton is able to discuss an issue without relying on flat out bs is why he was one of the best potus in my life time and i have been around for more than half a century personally i think he is only helping enough to be able to say he helped but is pulling for romney to win so that in years hillary would have a chance at running for pres i think if she ran against obama this time in the primaries she would have won if she did i think it would be a tough battle for romney given the state of the country i think we need someone like romney but i could do without the gop conservative social issues
710512988,you just hold that thought it will soothe you come the thumping obozo will take in november
710512988,go away
710512988,oh my bill is of the nobama winter ghai fest card sending lol
710512988,unfortunately politifact didn't look at all the facts as many people have noted the plant in question was going under before bain ever came in if bain had not purchased the company it likely would have closed many years earlier thereby causing all the employees to lose their jobs even sooner would that have been a better result it also ignores the fact that romney was no longer with bain when the plant closed down thus while the ad may be mostly true in what it says it is patently false because of what it doesn't say obama's class warfare strategy will only work on the anti capitalists still dreaming of a socialist usa the rest of us who believe in success based on merit and don't believe it's a crime to make a profit are looking forward to obama leaving the white house in january
710512988,this from a man who did away with glass steagall and raised a derivatives trader i suggest we all get used to governance by and for wall street
710512988,voting for obama in is like backing up the titanic and hitting it again
710512988,if there's any doubt that romknees didn't let a few companies fall into bankruptcy for bains profit then you too depend on political contributions this hero of business lido anthony lee iacocca is just like romknees he served as president and ceo of chrysler from and additionally as chairman from until his retirement at the end of one of the most famous business people in the world iacocca was a passionate advocate of u s business exports during the s yes famous to business but how did he pull off the chrysler miracle upping sales a better business model or did he increase his own pay and bonuses and cancel his employees double time pay at the same time moving parts manufacturers to foreign sweatshops if romknees gutted one company to bolster bains wallet and left american workers holding the cement overshoes then he ought to be jailed not made president over all those that he crushed on the way up
710512988,the truth always hurts gatorman but then being a political bloggist for karl rove like you must leave you empty and vulnerable to outbursts of anger
710512988,who don't want five wife's good old romknees is just like charles manson in everything he does
710512988,do you have like questions about the current president do you have any experience with private enterprise do you think that being a community organizer is enough experience to attempt to regulate businesses what are your college records hiding and why are they closed why did you let a known terrorist help you plot your stolen election
710512988,sounds like a person who has failed in life and cannot understand personal responsibility
710512988,too bad president obama needs this low life to campaign for him especially when this low life wants him to lose
710512988,do you preform late term abortions and how much do you get paid to put the needle in the baby to kill it
710512988,no it would not be like that if that is the best your fetid mind can accomplish well pity is what you deserve
710512988,no doubt about it you have the depth of mentality as much as arizona roadkill in august
710512988,well no one is saying romney is not qualified to run for president what is being said is he does not have the track record to support his claims of being better on the economy there is a difference and in fact the track record romney brings is that he was a good vulture capitalist enriching himself and his investors beyond his wildest dreams somehow he thinks that translates in to being good at creating jobs not true
710512988,that's all we need is a former president who could not pass his own ethics threshold test to be the arbitrator of what and who is qualified to this former president who faced a house impeachment vote and flat out lied to the american public i repeat i did not have sexual relations with that woman it's truly reprehensible we get to see him time after time as a much quoted figure i am not sure what gives with our appetite for men who are moral failures
710512988,you are like an immature first grader calling him romknees ha ha tell us when to laugh
710512988,first newark new jersey mayor cory booker attacks president obama for going after mitt romney on his business record then when asked if romney's former company bain capital was a bad company massachusetts governor deval patrick said no they are not a bad company now bill clinton says that romney s business record is sterling even other democrats while having to tow the democratic line in appearing to support him see obama s rhetoric as anti capitalist while by their statements keep him at arms length my question to clinton now is was that sterling gold or sterling silver
710512988,prepare for clinton in ' bill's laying the groundwork right now
710512988,the entire media have gotten this bain strategy wrong the obama strategy is playing out perfectly the strategy is to highlight romoney as a predator vulture capitalist and at the same time have surrogates say very nice things about bain because obama does not want to alienate the vast majority of voters who may be turned off by bashing bain
710512988,well grandpa ron you better take another look at the front porches i think your missing something
710512988,chuckey seems to be out of the loop when it comes to job creation somebody needs to get him a newspaper and a radio he s way out of touch
710512988,meaning that experience as a community organizer doesn't cross the threshold and by the way what the hell is a community organizer the guy who lines up the trash cans before the pick up
710512988,only a stupid socialist or a communist can make a comment so alien to the nature of business in a capitalist society that made possible for a moron like you to own the stupid computer with which your are writing the drivel spewing from your neuron empty head
710512988,sorry but your welfare check will stop arriving to your mail box after november so get used to it your only option will be start looking for a job after you run out of food stamps
710512988,better than being a slave of axelrod obama or joey biden
710512988,so your support obama because of unemployment are you stupid
710512988,it is refreshing to have some high ranking democrats speak out loud their true feelings about romney it makes you wonder just how many think that but do not want to express their feelings out loud
710512988,couldn't have said it better myself
710512988,go romney
710512988,romney's record at bain was indeed sterling and superb if one regards profit gained by investors as the sole measure of success romney judges a person's qualifications to lead based on the depth of one's wallet rather than the depth of one's wisdom he evaluates a person's net worth based on the value of one's portfolio rather than one's value to their community as is the case for many ultra wealthy conservatives mitt's financial success was attained at the expense of the middle class worker and in an expression of his patriotic loyalty to the united states by hiding his corporate earnings in offshore accounts mitt greed is good romney and bain capital had a penchant for buying companies laying off a significant part of the workforce rewarding themselves with huge bonuses taken from the acquired company's coffers and then often selling the company for a hefty profit mitt regards the middle class worker as expendable chattel he only evaluates businesses with respect to ways to maximize profit margins for the benefit of upper management and the major investors behavior which most people would regard as unethical is quickly dismissed by romney and other corporate bullies as being shrewd legal probably but just because you have the right to do a thing does not necessarily make it the right thing to do reason why mitt is completely out of touch with of the american public
710512988,clinton may see mitt romney as qualified as far as his professional expierence is concerned but is he an article ll 'natural born' citizen george romney mitt's father was born in mexico to expatriated us citizen parents who gave up their us citizen to be allowed by mexican authorities to colonize in mexico however under the fourth international conference of american states held on august there was signed at rio de janeiro a convention between the united states and most of the latin american countries including mexico it stated that if a naturalized citizen a native of any of the countries signing the present convention and naturalized in another shall again take up his residence in his native country without the intention of returning to the country in which he has been naturalized he will be considered as having re assumed his original citizenship and has having renounced the citizenship acquired by the said naturalization the problem is when george romney was born in mexico both of his parents were mexican nationals at birth george romney was a natural born mexican national and not a natural born us citizen when the romneys returned to us jurisdiction everyone was again a us citizen with the exception of george romney who was still a mexican national ex animo davidfarrar
710512988,is clinton still bitter or just plain stupid
710519517,for such a docile guy ask him to explain his vicious campaign of personal destruction of all who opposed him during primaries is this a sign of what we would see in the white house perhaps a closeted richard nixon
710519517,he needs to be more specific on how he will fix everything no spin no extremism and no unnecessary postures just how and what period
710519517,he's been terribly underestimated by the thugs in chitown herr axel is even having to crawl out of his bunker to personally take a shot today's jobs number wich will be well short of anything needed to bring down the u number will be a great opening to lay open obama's sorry record
710519517,mitt will be a fine president if his religion gives him inner peace and strength so be it i have never once heard him try and project his beliefs on anyone this country was built on religious freedom you have those on the left trying to take those very freedoms away you have those on the left that are agnostic atheist communist socialist mao worshipers and they do try and change this country mitt might just turn out to be a nice breath of fresh air give him a chance before judging
710519517,obama trolls seen lots of times this am posting stories on mormonism
710519517,i am interested in electing a person who can step into the job and turn the economy around pure and simple the incompetent community organizer is like a three year old trying to do an adult job he is clueless another four years of his socialist government and we will be a defeated nation mitt romney is a genuine person who doesn't act like the usual politician i do believe that his main goal is to help this country to become great again unlike the anti american obama who is out to bring us down as payback for his perception of american arrogance
710519517,it's called politics ron do you honestly think that your hero didn't do the same to hillary clinton in and others who got in his way in chicago politics obama makes richard nixon look like an amateur at dirty politics
710519517,you are a willfully blind ideology driven biggot
710519517,the increasingly hysterical posts from the moronic libs proves they sense this thing is slipping away the truth is extremely painful to these liars like sunlight on a vampire as michael savage says liberalism is a mental disorder
710519517,i liken libs to cockroaches especially the ones here when the room gets full of sunshine thru facts they scurry for cover
710519517,romney is coming out as a neo mormon bill kristol will neobar mitzvah him
710519517,you are a neobigot
710519517,he is times the leader than the anti military bigot obama
710519517,comment from a putz mr obama had his chance he has blown it it is time to try a new approach i am not saying mr romney is the answer but it time to get off the pot what we really need is to threaten all of the house and senate members either do your jobs or leave the political arena we pay these clowns no pay for no work
710519517,and you sir are just a obama idiot drone you want to have a conversation lets do it you sound like joe sam or some of the others that post here sorry buddy but lets get down to how to fix this country if not we might as well move to mexico and learn to speak spanish and give up all our freedoms
710519517,thank goodness americans have a proven business leader in candidate romney to pull the u s and world economies out of their current path toward economic despair obama should have prioritized jobs and economic growth as president instead of pushing a progressive takeover of u s healthcare and student loans when the largest world economy the u s economy is stumbling then the fallout on the world economy can be severe economic stats out today confirmed that world economies including the u s china india and particularly europe are slowing measurably fears of a worsening european and world economic slowdown are sending u s bond yields to all time lows today the european union is near economic collapse spain and greece have entered depressionary conditions with runs on their banks and the fallout here on the u s is unavoidable as the u s economy continues to slow and shed jobs the challenger jobs report just confirmed that u s layoffs are picking up again the report revealed that job cuts jumped by percent in may from april in the united states yes november can't come soon enough
710519517,i think this is all good but the romney campaign also has to keep an eye on substance coherence and vision for the future not to sound like a finance geek but alan greenspan just made some enormously important bigthink statements on cnbc today the romney campaign needs to digest those principles and explain how they undergird the whole view of markets and free economy that romney is talking about get a tape of this morning's show and study greenspan explains succinctly why central command and control is inefficient and wasteful and results in an ever lowering standard of living despite tom friedman's assertions that approach is worse for a society not better you get no innovation no experimentation which requires risking and losing private capital those are what make progress and raise standards of living that's why china has to steal our ideas and secrets it can mass produce stuff but it can't think up new ideas it needs our free democracy as a resource for those that's why they have to crawl all over our academies private infrastructure and think tanks gobbling up american made thoughts if we turn into china all that's gone and you can't do that with a new czar for innovation in the wh either a central authority technocrats in far away washington ends up causing tremendous waste fiddling away hard earned tax dollars which had they been left in the pockets of those who earned them would be used far more efficiently and surgically to bolster the economy and as a spin off create jobs
710519517,mitt doesn't needhumanizing he's already more substancethan image it's the democrats who like images not substance
710519517,it's barely june and already polls numbers are moving mitt romney's way in battleground states north carolina and indiana have already returned to romney missouri and florida are also tilting his way early millions of voters are throwing their support and donations behind romney it will get better and better for mitt romney watch see romney take back the america we loved
710519517,i'm appalled by the remarks that obama is more personable than romney and that somehow takes center stage in the election get a grip and get a clue american is in trouble not only economically and financially but in the world as a whole and it will take far more than a personable candidate to get us moving in the right direction personality so far has not fixed a thing i don't care how personable the candidate is if he she is not qualified for the job or in obama's case has had years to at least to right the ship but instead has chosen to sink the ship you're out i don't care if they candidate is eye candy if he she can't do the job then out he she goes
710519517,so isn't so nice to see the in the tank for mr etch a sketch flip flop liar in chief wannabe draft dodger willard mittens romney the hill has joined the romney etch a sketch team just like all the rest of the mitt romney buttkissers that call themself news media nowdays folks the hill has become nothing but another mitt romney shill
710519517,as this campaign season progresses we will hear more and more of mitt romney he will talk and talk in ways which he hopes will put his character in the best light don't be deceived by it we already know all we need to reject mitt romney he is a thug and a sociopath that is the essence of his character it developed early and continued to develop throughout his life from the moment he picked up a deadly weapon to assault a classmate through his life in the business world slashing jobs and impoverishing workers to the public policy proposals which will starve babies and leave seniors to die on the street mitt romney has preyed on others their suffering at his hands has never given him a moment's pause he has ignored it and continued to stuff his pockets with whatever their suffering has gained him has america really sunk so low it would put this monster in the white house is that what we have become
710519517,etch a sketch time but how long can romney do exclusively fox sooner or later he's going to have to break out of the rightwing echo chamber and do a real interview live on camera
710519517,back when white people ran america huh
710519517,sorry john but your hero rino willard mittens romney is a job destroyer not a job creator so go google the free video when mitt romney came to town and weep you silly misinformed fool
710519517,oh come on there is nobody on earth as arrogant as mitt romney
710519517,question how can romney's humanize campaign work when no republican is human
710519517,no matter how many times you repeat those lies about romney they will still be lies joey and they are not even fresh lies starve babies leave seniors to die on the street you need to get some new material
710519517,nope since we have had to hear about the drive by gov of ma and his flips and flops and lies non stop far too long already just say no to willard mittens romney american jobs destoryer in
710519517,why it's the same old story the rich think they are entitled to all they have and all everyone else has and romney is among the worst of the bunch he is a patrician who takes from everyone and feels absolutely no sense of obligation to anyone who wasn't born into wealth and power
710519517,draft dodger romney that's one thing which hasn't been mentioned nearly enough especially because it illustrates romney's sense of entitlement when the sons of lesser men fought to defend all romney had he stayed home enjoying what he had been given now of course he would send the others to die to defend what he has not his own sons of course just the sons of the lower classes
710519517,joey you and your ilk say that about every republican that comes down the road and you say it when the democrats sit back on their wealth and do nothing you are a boring and trite as your argument
710519517,and please provide for me the service record of president obama also provide for me the military career path that he has laid out for his own daughters do it now joey
710519517,sorry ralph even your here former president bill clinton on thursday said gop nominee mitt romney's business experience crosses the qualification threshold did you not see the dreadfull employement reports out today obama simply has not kept his promises on bringing down the unemployment rate or creating jobs obama could have at least approved the keystone pipeline which would have created tens of thousands of jobs no no no obama would prefer to pander to votes from the greenies than create jobs for americans obama's priorities are upside down stop drinking the obama kool aid and wake up you are just a usefull tool for the progressive radical agenda
710519517,here's all you need to know obama never stayed home when other men went to fight get it romney is just another yellow elephant
710519517,obama never served so he did stay at home while others fought your hypocrisy is screaming joey
710519517,sooner or later americans will want to see his tax returns what is he hiding is he waiting on the statute of limitations willard is a rat
710519517,back when white people ran america huh taking back the america we loved means taking it out of the control of marxist incompetents doesn't matter what color they are you racist
710519517,people like ralph can't get past their immature willard mittens rhetoric he couldn't bother to read bill clinton's latest pro romney declaration probably could't understand it anyway
710519517,oh come on is there anybody on earth as arrogant as mitt romney yes yes yes his name is barak hussein obama
710519517,willard is not concerned about the very poor willard likes to fire people the willard and the donald money first willard the oligarch says corporations are people the willard hides in france while americans go to war willard is a bully willard is a rat willard is worse than w
710519517,frank that is an immature stupid comment if i ever read one this will get your nowhere but keep it up it's good for the gop
710519517,actually the willard didn't stay home he hid out in france
710519517,no obama was too busy being friends with anarchists and bombers like william ayres to do any military service
710519517,amen kala voting for personality and image is what got us into our present debacle
710519517,you are probably right phalaanx but the great god greenspan had a lot to do with our present economic mess he is trying to back away from his part in it all but it won't work
710519517,i am glad you republicans are a shrinking minority who would admit to being republican after the last decade of representing only the and the biggest corporations they nearly destroyed our country with their spending and wars and now they continue to drag their feet and obstruct any attempt to fix it willard would drive this country back into the ditch to consolidate more wealth at the very top for his elite ceo constituents if you believe he would work for you then you are either a multi millionaire or a fool gop rip and good riddance
710519517,some don't serve during peacetime others dodge the draft during wartime which is worse
710519517,in your case joe whichever one has the r after their name is worse
710519517,just as mi guel resp onded i am ins pired that pe ople can earn in we eks on the comp uter did you rea d this we b si te c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710519517,when someone is born the governor's boy and daddy becomes ceo of american motors serving in the military is considered somerthing those people do it is beneath him taking orders from someone that doesn't have a college education just because he has more stripes on his sleeve is unthinkable people like romney and his sons don't even consider serving in our armed forces i served as a marine and it was one of the best decisions i have ever made i think it would be good for all young people to serve a couple of years
710519517,he has already shown them
710519517,he was never a draft dodger you and your left talking points make you look like a fool his ss number was a high one not his fault if you even knew about the draft
710519517,so do i td and i appreciate your service my son is a marine semper fi my issue is with joey slamming romney for not serving while at the same time defending obama for not serving
710519517,the continual attack on successful people in this country is not working i'd rather vote for a successful businessman rather than a career politician whose money comes from his government connections we need competence not more hype and blame romney
710519517,i dont think that romney is ever going to grab the attention of anyone
710519517,the more you talk the better i like romney competence over hype and blame
710519517,perhaps you forgot mittens is a career politician
710519517,i guess we can add hypocrite to romney's list of character attributes doubtless he joined in the france bashing during the early days of bush's war in iraq but france is where he hid during his war
710519517,so when mittens get elected it will give the mormon church free reign to baptise all they can into their faith without their concent the christian talaban will love that but they got what they sold their souls for
710519517,true but it's worth looking at i think greenspan is returning to his roots
710519517,you guys just have to use the race card don't you
710519517,sooner or later we might get to see obama college records as well
710519517,most politicians don't work against their own country even if they prefer not to join the military obama worked against this country that is the difference
710519517,so remind e which part of the military was obama in
710519517,i hope you are right good comment
710519517,you know nothing more than the democrat talking points that have come out about romney do you know about the vast amounts he has given to charity do you know about the incredible amount of service he has provided to those in need over the years do you know that he gave away his inheritance do you know that he worked as governor and as head of the slc olympics without taking a salary this is your definition of someone who takes from others and gives nothing back feel free to keep up with your class warfare arguments though the american people are tired of hearing from folks who believe success should be punished and that failure is always someone else's fault and that's why they are going to vote obama out in november
710519517,once more which military branch was obama in thats right none he was in college skipping the draft
710519517,can you name anything in romney's history that would indicate he looks upon the military with disdain you make a lot of assumptions about romney's character in your comment yet you clearly know nothing about him no he didn't serve in the military but for you to cast aspersions on his character and blindly lump all people who are financially successful into the category of arrogant uncaring people is unfair to quote a phrase obama loves to use if romney looks down on our armed forces as you suggest why do so many more veterans support him than support the president i thank you for your service to your country but that doesn't give you the right to cast judgement on someone you clearly know nothing about
710519517,g greedy o one p percent
710519517,first you should understand an issue before you bring it up mormon doctrine is that those who are baptized after death still get to choose whether or not they accept the baptism thus no one in this life or the next is baptized against their will second please show me examples of how the church tried to influence the ma government when romney was governor or examples of how he used that office to promote his religious beliefs the fact is you can't because neither ever happened thus there is no reason to believe either would happen if romney becomes president
710519517,what horrors according to the article romney was taught by his church to obey rules and be a good person and then he had the nerve to teach others the same things clearly that disqualifies him from being president
710519517,good thing for romney and the neocons that this is truly about anybody but obama for many people because all that the liberal romney brings to the table is that he isn't obama that's it
710519517,hey ralph check out the jobs report the debt obamacare solyndra and all the other screw ups by obama the sumpreme idiot mitt has more business know how in his little pinky than the entire obama administration have a nice weekend eating on food stamps ralph i'm going to ruth's chris 'cause i'm a business man
710519517,good lets get to know mitt romney even bill clinton says romney is qualifiied and i'm tired of all the misinformation about mitt romney even from conservatives
710519517,well since we sank to new lows putting obama in the white house i see anybody else as being a improvement but mitt romney who has many supporters including bill clinton i say go mitt give libs a fit
710519517,ummm george romney mitt's father left all his money to charity and mitt and his brothers didn't inherit their dads money just a bit of fact there genius
710519517,j ust as na than repl ied i'm sho cked that a per son able to ma ke in a few w eeks on the com puter di d you se e thi s si te li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710519517,face it you have no ground to stand on your talking points are the same sh t so tell me ole wise one why didn't he sign up for the army
710519517,dont have to prove it just use conservative tactics used by bush if you say it or tell a lie enough it eventually becomes the truth
710519517,so they will try to make him look more human to us do that means they will erase that phony perennial smile
710519517,those first two paragraphs are a real hoot humanize romney good luck with that mitt never yells at ann or slams doors he just locks her in the cellar and kicks the dog
710519517,this man has no connection to the daily lives of real people clearly he has never lived the daily life he never will same for his wife he does not get real people obama always did and always will
710519517,'reintroduction' is that the name they're calling romney mr 'etch a sketch' you can't 'humanize' a robot you can't make someone appear to care about average people when they've always detested average people and has always regarded them as collateral damage in his quest for riches romney is a greedy pig through and through he's all about the and cares nothing about the rest of us our lives or our jobs he's a job killer who cares if he's nice to his wife and kids he's all wrong for the job of president of all americans not just the rich

710519517,no he has not
710519517,bill clinton did not endorse willard
710519517,the only charity he has given too is his church where most of it goes to politics he did not give away his inheritance he did not work as governor for free or for the olympics for free get real
710519517,willard is a loser
710519517,willard protested for the vietnam war but went to france to keep from serving his father or grandfather did not serve and none of his adult sons have served the romney family is a family of cowards
710519517,that is a lie
710519517,lie it was arranged by daddy that he do mission work in france
710519517,he was not old enough for the draft his grandfather was a ww veteran
710519517,obama was not a draft dodger like willard willard protested for the war but daddy arranged that he go to france to keep from serving willard is a c o w a r d
710519517,he was not a friend of ayres he hardly knew him that is so yesterday
710519517,you idoit he was not old enough for the vietnam draft and there hasn't been one since guess we know that you didn't serve you couldn't pass the physical they don't take that are people missing a brain
710519517,willard is an empty suit
710519517,mormonism is a cult
710519517,willard will never be potus
710519517,willard can't even run a state what makes you think he can run a country
710519517,obama never served period you are condemning in one what you condone in another no surprise
710519869,obama must be replaced because he is destroying our country with bad policies and illegal aliens furthermore obama is a socialist and does not want to remove from office his friend eric holder doj obama must go in we will vote obama out in
710519869,the white house and mainstream media are emphasizing some of the most transitory and superficial economic data to suggest that president obama will take the swing states that he took in but that are in play now it is true that these states have had some recovery in employment rates even though these rates are still higher than in and the current rates are in essence overly optimistic because relatively large numbers of people aren't counted since they have given up looking for jobs because they believe the prospects are poor what these democrats don't talk about is the obama administration's broad fiscal policy management or how people in these states may consider this area when thinking about how they will vote this november due to nonstop trillion annual fiscal deficits the federal debt will have risen by trillion to trillion during president obama's term the obama administration's forecast is that the federal government's fiscal balance will stay hugely in deficit for years even for decades and that it will rise by another trillion to trillion by the long range unfunded liabilities of the federal government medicare social security obamacare medicaid pensions etc now exceed trillion the obama administration has ignored the president's own bipartisan debt commission's recommendations about dealing with these subjects and preferred to pretend that the extremely weak fiscal condition of the federal government doesn't exist at all it is much easier to act like the ongoing immense federal spending and borrowing can continue indefinitely the people are not stupid they know that we cannot continue to have a profligate federal government that lives far above the nation's means they know how little mr obama has done to address these overarching federal government fiscal problems conditions that will have a vast impact on the nation for generations to come what will matter more in the swing states and in the other states for this november is how the two presidential campaigns discuss these critical long term economic issues so far romney has devoted much more effort to address these subjects it is hard to imagine that obama who has never distinguished himself as a politician who favors government fiscal retrenchment or reducing the burdens of government regulations will change
710519869,good god they still can't be honest about the figures or how they came up with them people not looking people opting out and the million they took off the unemployment lists and entered them as disability nothing but more mumbo jumbo and wand waving
710519869,the report is bogus it is always revised downward in the following month jobs is barely enough to keep up with population growth i would have to say that mr romney is going to blister mr obama's a with these statistics not to mention the numbers that came out yesterday with regard to the downward revision of the gdp mr obama's lack of economic experience is over whelming he has no clue nor does is cabinet or czars
710519869,well i'll take romney because in years we have lost jobs and cant even keep up with population increases k isnt doing it we need k just to keep pace we are becoming greece and italy under this president we need a businessman to run this govt and tighten to fiscal belt
710519869,average duration of unemployment now at weeks civilan employment participation down to
710519869,my best guess is k mas o menos
710519869,subtle religious bigotry good job you obama troll now go back to herr axel and tell him you've been outed
710519869,economy can't reach escape velocity with obama's voodoo
710519869,u underemployment now at
710519869,the machinations by the obama administration to get the unemployment rate under by election day is laughable but so dishonest then the main stream press can loudly crow about the great job that obama is doing with the falling rate what a joke romney
710519869,there is no battle to be had it's real simple obama committed to green energy promising million jobs across the country for an investment of billion a year in renewable enrgy sources the truth be known wind energy has lost jobs since even though it doubled its domestic production this boils down to obama spending billion of the stimulus on green energy and at the end of the day only people got jobs and the number should have been this is nothing less than ammo for romney and esepcially with the failure of solyndra who was given a million federal loan not only are obama's green initiatives failing he is now back peddling on his health care reform those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
710519869,no president since ronald reagan has been re elected with a unemployment rate of or higher as a matter of fact reagan in his first term had a ue rate of over for months two of those months at in late and didn't get below until october of almost the half way point of his second term the difference is that obama was handed a catastrophe far worse than reagan faced
710519869,romney will own the news cycle today obamanuts will trot out mark zand i who is acknowledged to be the worst eco hack to no avail
710519869,obozo has zero i mean zero legs to stand on in the jobs area or any area for that matter except in the area of marxist doctrine now i will give him that he is probably an expert in marxism karl didn't like to work either
710519869,david axelrod is the biggest liar in america pathetic obama is the first president ever to have a net job loss after years romney has created more jobs at staples alone than these democratic frauds state wipe out for the gop
710519869,herr axel obama's minister of truth and carney bagdad bob
710519869,only k jobs huge miss

710519869,jobs created in may barry is toast and the hill can't save him
710519869,obama has sue four american states on behalf of his la raza party base of illegals why hasn't he been impeached for this he's sue arizona to impose his open borders agenda to stop e verify to ease more illegals into our jobs to keep wages depressed and sued az to stop them from requireing illegals have id to vote next to mexico city phoenix is the largest center for mexican kidnapping it is america's center for mex car theft and home invasion obama has squandered billions protecting the muslim dictators' borders from each other and left ours open and undefended according to ca attorney gen kamala harris nearly half of all murders in mexifornia are by mex gangs can we afford more of la raza obama it is america s biggest center for mexican home invasion there are a hundred guides sitting on mountaintops right now in arizona guiding the drug cartels as they bring the drugs across the arizona mexico border up to phoenix where they are distributed throughout the nation mexicanoccupation blogspot com
710519869,worse still are the revisions to prior months april revised down to k
710519869,romney no thanks willard mitt romney expert american job destoryer greedy arrogant bain capital vulture businessman in
710519869,romney's plan flat out lie mitt romney created more jobs in the state of massachusetts than president obama has for the entire nation spokeswoman andrea saul said
710519869,net job loss under obama doofus
710519869,haha guess that didn't work out so well obama has no clue what it's doing or it does and it's doing it intentionally and the revised gdp and bad jobs numbers show that he either will not or cannot do anything for the economy
710519869,let's get one thing straight less than percent of the country will vote for mitt romney a much larger percentage will vote against obama combine the two and romney might make this close but not because of anything romney brings to the table true conservatives don't like him the tea party doesn't like him only the gop establishment the ones who think bush did a good job like him he has flipped on core conservative issues abortion gun control government healthcare so righties should just continue to bash obama and leave the go mitt nonsense out of it its bs so save it
710519869,but how many jobs are filled with illegals using stolen social security numbers la raza will reelect obama sonia sotomayor opposes e verify requirement true to form she said it was illegal to make employers e verify citizen status of new hires interesting she says a state cannot force employers to check if employees they are hiring are illegal thankfully the court ruled supporting law but now we know for sure just how extreme far left obama's choice was we cannot afford obama to get another term or you can bet this country will be overrun by illegals i don't want this country to be poor and corrupt like mexico which it will if illegals overrun the country obama administration challenges arizona e verify law the obama administration has asked the supreme court to strike down a arizona law that punishes employers who hire illegal aliens a law enacted by then governor janet napolitano solicitor general's amicus curiae brief called the legal arizona workers act the law requires all employers in arizona to use e verify and provides that the business licenses of those who hire illegal workers shall be repealed from the date of enactment the chamber of commerce and other special interest groups have been trying to undo it attacking it through a failed ballot initiative and also through a lawsuit now the chamber is asking the united states supreme court to hear the case chamber of commerce v candelaria and the obama administration is weighing in against the law
710519869,advantage romney
710519869,nope bush is he lost more jobs in this country
710519869,we became greece and italy under bush and obama was handed a bag of crap on day one
710519869,truth hurts
710519869,that's not true but guess what the jobs a starting to disappear again who are you going to blame
710519869,bill clinton had an interesting interview in the last day or two he said that bain is an astute organization and romney has all the qualifications needed to be president don't you find that interesting
710522568,republicans do not want anyone who will compromise we want someone who will act like the rest of us and be a big fool have you ever got everything you wanted in any relationship you ever had in your life it would be nice of republicans grew up
710522568,so you ever try to dig into obama's background i didn't think so
710522568,was the idiot joe biden not polarizing enough back in
710522568,yup you are a big fool as shown by that comment
710522568,so exactly what are you trying to say
710522568,what in the heck are you trying to say we have reached across the aisle we have presented multiple budgets that reid declared doa the dems have broken the law by not presenting a budget in years they have become the party of no now who is being childish
710522568,obama troll and bigot alert
710522568,omg are we dealing with another dick lugar
710522568,we don't need no stinking rinos on da ticket
710522568,yes portman is as bad as lugar if he is chosen it's a big slap in the face from the rnc establishment politicians
710522568,bipartisanship reaching across the aisle that's why we are trillion in debt
710522568,let's not be too critical here afterall this is the office of the vice president we're talking about he she has three jobs on a daily basis check on the health of the potus attend funerals of rd world dictators if lucky cast a deciding vote in the us senate anyone can do this job just ask joe biden
710522568,bipartisanship is a means not an end compromise and working with others in order to get things done isn't the goal it's the strategy being able to work with others is a minimal standard what you have to look at when hiring a vp or any politician is what are their policy objectives what do they think is good for society what are their guiding principles it's where they want to take the country not whether they're bipartisan or can compromise the latter is tactics the former strategy when they say they want to get things done take that shudder it sends up your spine and ask get what things done as we have seen the past four years paralysis can be less destructive than getting the wrong thing done
710522568,when it's inevitable that republicans have the upper hand in government the democrats and mainstream media push for middle of the road republicans who can compromise make deals with the other side of the aisle and pretty much not cause any waves i e rino traitors conversely when the democrats have the upper hand do you see any evidence of 'compromise' or conciliatory behavior comrade maobam said it best after the general election losing elections has consequences it's a typical marxist ploy when you have the upper hand deny your enemy everything when your enemy has the upper hand negotiate compromise and promise the moon to him but do not deliver fight socialism no compromise no surrender
710522568,like el len an swered i cant bel ieve that some one can pr ofit in four wee ks on the comp uter have you se en th is we bsite c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710522568,another big spending republican whens it going to end
710522568,his reputation as a former trade amabassador for george w bush who loaded up usa factories on barges and then sold them to the nations who could provide the lowest wages the non safety standards the no environmental standards he was an economic traitor then he is one now i am a republican of the conservative sort and i loathe what this man has done to the usa he sold it for personal gain
710522568,if he worked with mark pryor we know we don't want him on the ticket markie will be out in just like blanchie in his daddy david will not be able to help him
710522568,i can't believe how many tea party terrorists are on thehill com bipartisanship is evil yes it would be horrid if congress actually did things that everyone agreed upon besides the of americans that consider themselves right wing libertarians
710522568,the elites are feverishly trying to build a case for him which does the opposite for me
710522568,ju st as judy expl ained i cant bel ieve th at any b ody able to pr ofit in wee ks on the in ternet did you see th is w eb li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710522568,some of you clowns are hilarious we don't a rino on the ticket too funny the man at the top of the ticket has flipped and flopped on abortion gun control government healthcare taxes and fees romney is the definition of rino but you are worried about portman you think romney is suddenly conservative beacause he says so his history of saying what he thinks will work at the time for votes is long and checkered lmao
710522568,obama's best chance is if romney picks another extreme whack job like palin for instance rubio
710522568,that's what we need someone who is beltway insider approved
710522568,lmao only in your fox induced insulated world do republicans have the upper hand they democrats have the white house and senate and obama still leads romney albeit not by much upper hand too funny
710522568,li ke how ard repl ied i am sho cked that any bo dy can pro fit in wee ks on the in ternet did you look at this webp age c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710522568,the use of pejoratives in your post clearly illustrates that you are attempting to use the tactic of projection do not bother
710522568,fiscal sanity is a multicycle effort richard lugar is gone bob bennet is gone democrats have resigned from the house joining who have resigned from the senate reyes was just thrown out in texas nelson is gone in nebraska replaced by deb fischer a fiscal conservative in race after race big spenders will be thrown out whether they are republican or democrat make sure to vote in
710522568,the dnc has given up on the house and the republicans have taken the senate if current numbers hold of course they have the upper hand
710522568,lugar was thrown out this cycle bennet was thrown out last cycle as was specter ben nelson is gone replaced with tea party supported deb fischer in nebraska jon tester is likely gone and in lindsay graham is already facing delcared primary opponents fiscal sanity is a multicycle effort make sure you vote in
710522568,which are the polls you're watching there astro
710522568,so you're laughably presenting zero by which republicans have reached across the aisle awesome
710522568,projection except for the mutual disgust with patriot act there's nothing i agree with those teabaggers on
710522568,obama is the gratest prezident we every had
710522568,obama is thee gratest prezident we evr had
710522568,bs republicans have done nothing to compromise on any issue since a black man was elected our president
710522568,one mark against sen rob portman r ohio being mitt romney s vice presidential choice may be that portman s not sufficiently polarized what a ridiculous statement to begin a ridiculous article could it be as simple as the fact that most americans don't even know who portman is could it be that voters are looking for someone dynamic to take on the radicals could it be that some of us have reservations about bush associated politicians get a clue
710522568,i feel sorry for you you have drunk the kool aid that is killing the democrat party please inform yourself and stop listening to the race baiters that are using you to advance their cause it is democrats who are reviving racial animosity in the country for their own ideological ends its disgraceful
710522568,selecting a currently serving senator would be extremely stupid
710522568,like orrin hatch this guy has to much washington baggage if they have been in there longer than years they have been in there to long i don't know about you guys but i have never heard of this guy never heard anyone even speak of him i am going to read more of what his thoughts are on the issues we are facing before i make any final judgements i am a utahn and i know romney wants us to keep orrin hatch in but orrin hatch has voted to far left to many times
710522568,if you do not like socialism you should not be watching the nfl or nhl
710522568,except congressional republicans still have higher negatives than democrats
710522568,then why is romney on the ticket
710522568,says a coward who hides under anonymous names then tries to beak off about transparency and accountability so funny and stupid
710522568,why don't you care about the messican usurper
710522568,funny no tea party person is talking about the patriot act go figure perhaps they're too stupid to recognize that boehner demint bachmann etc all voted in favor of it i get critisizing obama for signing it believe me i get that but why not critisize your own tea party conservatives for voting on it that proves that these tea party leaders are hypocrites who want their government
710522568,portman would be good at treasury a better choice for vp would be col allen west from florida romney needs someone with strong military experience and col west is the man to fill that role he would likely bring florida as well
710522568,as da wn rep lied i am sur prised t hat a m om can make in wee ks on the int ernet hav e you see n thi s w eb s ite c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710522568,portman like daniels is tainted by his helping bush start the finacial crisis we are in
710544868,that joe biden d del was a longtime member of the senate foreign relations committee only indicates how low the bar is set
710544868,what planet are you on what are you smoking obama's foreign skills are great as are biden's you are just talking here and blowing smoke sheesh
710544868,for sure with all those year's of experirence and knowledge gained as a community organizer o's skills were sharply honed please pour us all some kool aid and pass out the kaleidoscope glasses we'd all like to live in the fantasy world you're in
710544868,correction years of
710544868,overdosed on your daily allotment of stupid pills
710544868,the only thing the divider in chief believes is sticking it to everybody what doesn't dawn on the idiots is since the rich don't have to money to pay down the debt he'll just keep working his way down like the governor of maryland is doing the one thing you can always rely on a liberal is they want to spend everyone else's money
710544868,cheri jacobus excellent article as always but you need to mention the de facto president slumlord valerie jarrett who is also allowed to attend high level meetings anti business progressive liberals jarrett and alexrod are the braintrust of the obamas the havoc that the non elected obama's socialist advisors jarrett and alexrod have reeked on the american people needs to be exposed keep fighting the good fight
710544868,what is clear is that obama places political implications for his own reelection fairly high on the list of consideration when deliberating matters affecting the nation s security in a post era agreed and that is a huge problem the interests of the us and it's citizens should be above politics jeff
710578811,day one better be repeal obamacare as promised
710578811,actually this is quite a good article not very partisan if you read the nyt wapo politico and all the rest of the usual suspects they are starting to get nervous omg obama might lose so the news partisan attacks are starting to ramp up into full gear example obama recently stupidly insulted the polish and in return the polish foreign minister called obama ignorant and incompetent newsbusters the nyt ignored the story instead they focused on the outrage that the romney camp had committed a typo in their most recent iphone app anyway thanks for the story
710578811,all we get from obama and his minions are fantasies about windmills and ice cream castles in the air its refreshing to hear a politician talk about real jobs for real people in the real world
710578811,does this mean a large number of exective orders will be issued on january if you are running for office don't you make promises that indicate you are against the policies of the other party remember a politician will promise anything that the polls say the public generally doesn't like or what the views of their party are polls don't vote people do
710578811,republicans have slammed and slandered obama for years now and romney has the gall to say he'll 'take the hgh road' incredible
710578811,do what you dems liberals always do blame bush nothing is ever your fault nor do you have a solution just more spending and larger deficients
710578811,yeah thats true how are you liking obammys hope and change he is horrible he and his bride take more vacations than a jet setter
710595407,sounds right mises org freemarket detail aspx control
710595407,this is news the wife of a very popular republican president has endorsed the present republican candidate woopie
710595407,who cares what this has been has to say she had her day in the sun why can't she just go away and leave us alone
710595407,i think the lemonade and cookies would be a better president
710595407,it's amazing that this makes the news that being said she was the lady that used here astrological beliefs to help 'ronnie' run the whitehouse laughable let these types all endorse romney just goes to my point that the republicans have no clue or a candidate to run against obama their end is coming
710595407,the wife of the guy that let the communists steal millions of green jobs because of his ignorance of the green revolution and it's manufacturing jobs gives her support to the outsourcing job destroying wage cutting romknees since the red corporate republican't gets almost all of it's political donations from the rich that pay the american worker it's no surprise that everything they do is to destroy the american workers wages the bain romknees profits came from destroying high wage jobs and turning them into minimum wage jobs foreign sweatshop jobs and illegal immigrant jobs making romknees and his investors rich and leaving an american rust belt and a bankrupt american worker working three jobs just to feed his family living under the viaduct
710595407,rinos wrapping their arms around rinos
710595407,maybe michelle should use her astrological beliefs to help barrack run the white house i'm just sayin' it couldn't hurt any worse than him effing it up now right
710602756,but we'll have to pass it to know what's in it right probably will make it more communist and bureaucrat controlled than the current monster if that's possible
710602756,i can't wait to see obamacare
710602756,god hopes there is no second term keep dreaming mr obama
710602756,so mister obama says he may have to revise some parts of obamacare it it's declared unconstitutional huh folks a pigs ear can't be revised into a silk purse a vw can't be revised into anything but a vw with obamacare there is not enough pc obsessed revisionary lipstick in the world to make this legislative swine anything other than a pig
710602756,i know that granny rictus mcbotox implants is delusional now obozo is if this is struck down obamacare is dead forever
710602756,are you serious are you serious pelosi standing up for the constitution
710602756,nope this will be the push for single payer or medicare for all or something to try and push for his second term i would suspect the campaign strategy will be to attempt to get the outraged people who are mad it is struck down to edge out a victory and a second term the interesting thing is does anyone think they will have the courage to try this again even if they manage another term and will there be enough voters who are so out of touch and just sheeple to buy that this would happen in a second term with of likely voters wanting repeal i seriously doubt it
710602756,so obama thinks he should work on another sleezy under the table dark room private meeting working with lobists bill doing all the things he promised in he would not do with the attitude that he knows what is best for the people that the people are stupid we all know what he is now his book was a lie he was a part time college teacher and community organizer he had not experience ony a big attitude and huge ego send him home to chicago
710602756,i guess obama has forgotten the shellacking democrats took in even talking about this is stupid he's just going to rile up the voters who wanted obamacare killed
710602756,i'll say anything do anything to get re elected
710602756,i don't know what constitution pelosi claims to know so much about but the constitution for the united states grants no such authority to the jackals inhabiting the district of criminals if the shylock's in washington get away with forcing the people to buy insurance from private corporations under threat of fines and imprisonment there will be no limit to the products they deem mandatory under governmental authority should the supreme simians of the high court rule in favor of this atrocity it will be up to us to set them straight i will not meekly submit to indentured servitude for the benefit of some insurance cartels profit margin without a fight i buy insurance because i want it not because someone threatens to break my legs if i don't al capone
710602756,we need to pass it so we can find out what's in it bye bye obozocare bye bye death panels
710602756,lets just say for sake of argument he gets re elected and tries to redo obamacare how is he going to get that done he had to bribe senators when he had a super majority in both houses he doesn't even have a majority in congress and senators that helped pass it are in hot water or have been thrown out he hasn't a prayer of getting anything passed if you really want something done on health care obama has burned so many bridges and divided the nation so badly he will never get anything done short of signing a republican bill and a republican president can do that just as well judging by their reaction it looks like at least the mandate will be struck down
710602756,obamacare will probably state that if you can afford healthcare for your family you have to pay for another family that way more people will be covered by spreading your wealth look at what we have for a president
710602756,his claim that it passed with a strong majority is jaw dropping
710602756,yep we have the welfare food stamp occupant in the whitehouse right now sponging sponging and more sponging
710602756,the devil would love it if obama would have a second term this is good vs evil simple and to the point
710602756,obama is a f ing idiot of the country doesn't want this loser of a program and yet this a hole insists he knows better well if that were true where the hell are the jobs a vote for mitt id a vote against obamacare
710602756,if the republican democrat supreme death panel takes away health care from the fifty million uninsured the over one hundred million with pre existing conditions the parents of and the children who can stay on their policies until age the seniors who love having the donut hole removed from their prescription drug plan and the now free preventive care on medicare the early retirees between who take advantage of the early retiree reinsurance program those below of the federal poverty level who will qualify for medicaid those who use the small business health insurance exchange those who are now getting free preventive care on their health insurance without a co payment primary care doctors who will see their medicare payments increased and those who can no longer have their premiums increased because they are female the millions using the health clinics set up by the plan those saved from bankruptcy because of medical bills those families making up to a year who will receive subsidies for their health insurance premiums those who will save major dollars on their health insurance through a competitive exchange program and more then the grand ole party will be lucky to get a sheriff elected in south carolina in november that's how bad it will be isn't it ironic that ruling that the patient protection and affordable care act affectionately called obamacare by the gop is unconstitutional will destroy the november election for republicans you might say scalia roberts kennedy thomas and alito may go down in history for destroying the republican party forever in rural america that is called being stuck between a rock and a hard place oh i forgot those people will not be too happy to not have the rural health clinics built in their locales by the ppaca
710602756,dems are going to do damage control do you really think a republican controlled house and senate will let obama big if he wins a second term put through another bill to change health care no way obama no way
710602756,here's hoping you do not get the chance anyway if they do strike it down and then you bring it up as an issue it will work against you saying romney was for health care before he was against it will not work because there are many fip flops evolutions you have made over the years use that flip flop line mr president i dare you
710602756,li ke how ard repl ied i am sho cked that any bo dy can pro fit in wee ks on the in ternet did you look at this webp age c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710602756,revising the law is unsatisfactory even bob corker floated that one at davos in early it's not sufficient so both republicans and democrats can stop flirting with that idea this law did not follow transparent democratic legislative procedure it discounted the will of the people it was forced through despite the people massively registering clear opposition to it it's not just unconstitutional it's bad manners on washington's part you just don't behave this way to your people the reason revising it won't work is people distrust a massive centrally controlled bureaucracy working off undemocratic rules and guided by unelected panels making the most intimate decisions of your life the polls say this they want obamacare completely repealed but people do support certain limited provisions of this what do those results mean people want the of those who were satisfied with their insurance to be left alone the problems of healthcare should be reformed through incremental limited reforms that the majority do support that was the approach to healthcare reform the gop proposed in rather than institute a massive orwellian government run program address problems with surgical targeted legislation the fact that obamacare didn't address torte reform or malpractice issues that are the true cost of spiraling healthcare costs makes it a joke kind of like how dodd frank didn't address fannie mae and freddie mac i mean really folks we are currently spending enormous amounts of tax payer money building government infrastructure for obamacare and buying into huge data systems and centers to hold exchange and make available reams of medical information on all americans this is happening now a decision has to be made on what direction we're going in on medical care we're copying the system of a third world country when we are already the gold standard here it's insane
710602756,i also mr carney came out today and claimed obama never said that does he believe people believe him i mean he gets caught in defending lies almost everyday i do feel sorry for that guy he can't be as stupid as he appears obamacare is all but dead if the sc doesn't kill it a republican congress can defend it there will be no in the next four years there are some small things that could b epassed from it that people like and are not creating deficits but overall to believe it anything but dead is a pipedream obama wasted a good opportunity to listen to both sides and here what real experts had to say instead he had special interest write their own sections of a bill pasted them together in something so massive people are still finding underhanded additions and we are where we are today a failed piece of legislation that is likely unconstituional really sad when government has come to this what a waste of our time and tax dollars
710602756,nancy poops on the constitution like the rest of her comrads
710602756,let's see obama tries to demonize romney for heading a private equity firm at the same time he is attending fundraisers hosted by people heading private equity firms pelosi is talking out her butt first saying they have to pass the bill to know what is in it now claiming its constitutional does that mean she has finally read it obama has been trying to sell obamacare on the premise that it would lower medical costs and premiums for all and people are finally finding out just how much its going to raise costs premiums and devastate care for the elderly and the very poor his backup plan when the supremes strike it down is most likely the whole country sharing a big jar of ointment as reported in the onion
710602756,obamas plan anything to keep the american voters off center
710602756,not going to happen once it is struck down all we have to do is stop the money drain to hhs
710602756,he's planning on doing it from chicago while testifying before a federal court trying to keep valerie jarrett out of prison obama's administration is corrupt and his lead advisor is jarrett who was so corrupt that mayor daley fired her for corruption think about that mayor daley the corrupt mayor of chicago had to fire her for corruption and she's mochelle's and berry's best friend must we say more
710602756,obama can spend the rest of his life as a perpetual community organizer early next year obama is almost finished as potus
710602756,on thursday house minority leader nancy pelosi d calif repeated her previous assertion that the court would rule in the law's favor asked why she said i know the constitution this bill is ironclad it is ironclad this woman is demented she doesn't know jack sh
710602756,you are one sick puppy you posts the same garbage day after day why bother seeing your moniker makes it unnecessary to read the post just the same garbage
710602756,strong majority as in the obama reid pelosi socialist revolution of congress when the socialists had a strong majority and crammed a bunch of sawdust down our throats hoping to choke us to death an obama strong majority was the one party rule system which was disbanded and disarmed by the usa citizens in obama hasn't seen his strong majority in a very long time obama is almost finished obama has no majority of support
710602756,this is a desperation move and acknowledgment and confirmation of what a complete and absolute failure this corrupt and incompetent this buffonish clownish administration has been
710602756,on thursday house minority leader nancy pelosi d calif repeated her previous assertion that the court would rule in the law's favor asked why she said i know the constitution this bill is ironclad it is ironclad isn't she the same toad who said we have to pass it so we know what's in it even if she does know the constitution how the hell would she know if barrycare is constitutional by her own admission she never read the damn thing
710602756,obama is now running scared good
710602756,obama lied from day one sept before a joint session of congress these reforms healthcare will not benefit those here illegally aug hhs gives million dollars to fund new access points for free medical for migrants and seasonal workers immigration status will not be asked and all medical services must be provided so illegal aliens who never paid a stinking dime into the system get free healthcare while my premiums went up over a year my provider says because of newrules these democrats b st rds lied bribed extorted and crammed this down our throats it should be destroyed and let them start over and do it legally this time and fire obama the top b st rd
710602756,he can revise it all he wants to but if the scotus strikes the entire law the only way it passes again is if it gets through congress unless the democrats can once again win senate seats you can forget about it and why would american give the democrats that kind of control over the senate again the last time we ended up with a page bill that the democrats voted to pass without bothering to read it if obamacare dies at the supreme court it will not be revived
710602756,the president and his lackey supports in congress reid pelosi and other leading progressives don't need to do anything about this once the scotus strikes down this assault of personal freedom next month their betters will fix the issue sometime after the november elections fortunately the long night of terror that began in is almost over
710602756,the american people hate obamacare sarge i hate to be the one to tell you that but somebody has to
710602756,good thing he will not get a second term then
710602756,would someone tell the president that he doesn't get to revise legislation all he gets to do is sign or veto it
710602756,hey g f robot kool aid drinker a pre existing condition is not insurance it's welfare this is simple redistribution of wealth with king obama saying who gets what and who has to pay for it send that stupid communist obama back to kenya and you go with him
710602756,if its better than a decision will gi agree to stop posting
710602756,i'm shocked shocked that president obama would go to the home of a private equity firm's president to raise money to 'save' his job president obama has been telling us that those bastards are the people who fire 'folks' who said politics makes strange bedfellows
710602756,ah come on don't be so overly dramatic this is two people running for political office and that's all it's definitely not good vs evil demonizing those to whom you're opposed is an old tactic and does not fool anyone any more
710602756,you won't have a second term obama america is sick of your lies and more lies obama will be lucky to break of the vote in the nov election a new day dawns on america and its greatness on nov th obama is past history and the history books can be corrected that obama mislabeled
710602756,he perhaps meant a strong armed bare majority
710602756,she didn't tell us which constitution probably dsa
710602756,our ruler obama will tell us what powers he has like when obama signed the power to use us military forces to indefinitely detain usa citizens without notice trial l or charges speak freely while you still have the opportunity obama has more fundamental changes planned whether you want to go along with them or not
710602756,can i opt out of having obama holder racists determine my fate president drone murderer and his ag sidekick are not really fair when it comes to having open honest or transparent decision making while they made the easy decision to use drones to murder usa citizens president drone murderer is the st potus to implement a lie first policy when it comes to freedom of information act requests fast and furiously arming the obama invaders gathering in mexico gives many reason not to trust obama or any of his loyal followers currently in power if i can choose between and insurance company or president drone murderer i'll choose free enterprise capitalists over obama socialists any day does that make me a candidate for indefinite military detention under obama rules does usa citizenship matter to obama or just race
710602756,the only thing about pelosi that is iron clad is the dead end on the street named after her in baltimore years ago and it is cheap metal sign from china
710602756,if the supreme court rules obamacare unconstitutional hopefully that will kill it for good the republicans then will have a clean slate and an opportunity to formulate a new sensible healthcare plan from the ground up when they take over in please note the republicans know that all americans are stakeholders in a national healthcare plan and therefore it will be a bipartisan plan with buy ins all along the way before it is even voted on everyone will know what's in the bill and can feel good about it after all this time most of us stilli don't know exactly what's in the demo version of obama care
710602756,i would bet all that i have that you cannot produce death certificates that have lack of insurance as a cause of death furthermore no single person can be denied medical care in this country medical care and insurance are not the same things
710602756,the federal government has business in reforming health care this is not a federal issue
710602756,here we go again unemployment and we are talking again about wedoing obamacare is the liberals and president really that far out of touch with the american voters can not believe obama even has an approval
710602756,oh no national socialized medicine again obama fail
710602756,so that's his new desperate tactic to con more money out of his doners does he think they are stupid well i guess so they gave it to him before
710602756,wait you're bring up that what's it called it's been ignored for the last three years oh the constitution but remember this is the joe stalin wannabe who just said the troops are fighting for him
710602756,if you can show me a link to something besides a michael moore documentary i'll take this seriously but michael moore come on
710602756,if hahahahahahahahahahahaha
710602756,if michael moore had actual video of it raining outside i wouldn't believe it
710602756,still peddling that completely debunked lie about dying each year due to a lack of insurance
710602756,there will be a second term god bless the greatest president the us has ever had most of the bozos commenting below cannot even understand the ppaca what's that legislation
710602756,hey foghorn leghorn you are obviously an uninformed remf carry on
710602756,in obamas case he has earned the demonization
710602756,as cl ifford res ponded i di dnt kno w that som eone can get pa id in one mo nth on the int ernet ha ve you re ad t his li nk c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710602756,god what a liar
710602756,obama deserves to be arrested charged indicted tried convicted sentenced and imprisoned for the rest of his natural life along with david axelrod rahm emanuel val jarrett harry reid nancy pelosi barney frank chris dodd bill ayers wife and about a thousand other communists who have worked like dogs behind the scenes in the obama administration to undermine the unique liberty of we the people in the u s a any legitimate u s citizen who even thinks of voting for obama again should be ashamed of themselves obama is an enemy of we the people his actions prove it
710602756,bureaucrats love the idea of having all doctors and patients answering to them because it gives bureaucracy more power the more power bureaucrats have the safer they are in their lardbutt do nothing jobs bureaucrats at every level of government care infinitely more about their featherbed jobs than they do about the well being of we the people
710602756,too bad its going to be to you lose not me i have a job and very good insurance
710602756,seriously only people who believe free preventative care exists could swallow the line of crap above my dear liberal drone please start here nothing in life is free making money is hard work life isn't fair trying to pretend these truths don't exist doesn't make them go away
710602756,this special tv offer is only but wait if you call within the next ten minutes we'll send you this free set of surgical knives
710602756,my concern is that scotus will strike down the mandate but leave the rest of it standing that would create a mess that congress would be forced to fix that might be what obama is secretly hoping for if they uphold the whole thing it would get the right wing galvanized which could throw some swing states to romney if they throw out the whole thing it would galvanize the left wing potentially increasing super pac donations from big pharma and other special interests who want to see a government run health program if they overturn the mandate but keep everything else it might weaken the reaction on both sides which probably plays into obama's hands ever so slightly since he has the advantage of incumbency it forces both sides to the bargaining table where so far obama has won pr victories e g debt ceiling
710602756,we win include the blue pills so the doctor will not have to do the surgery
710602756,go burn a flag somewhere you want to be a ward of the state with central planing sorry it's not going to happen
710602756,wow so now that we've found out what's in it it needs revising the whole thing was a miserable failure and needs to go down with solyndra et all of obama's other bad ideas
710602756,too little too late your time and your political capital have been squandered
710602756,he probably never served in any branch either loser
710602756,just goes to prove odummer is a socialist communist marxist that he is and just how stupid he and the liberals are
710602756,yes kay most of the posters here understand that ppaca is caca
710602756,obama should be prepping for the unemployment line
710602756,if the president doesn't get to revise legislation then presumably he can't pass it either he can only sign or veto it so why isn't all this resentment directed at congress which did pass the bill no matter be how small a margin it passed the congress now why dones't everyone just sit tight until the court delivers its opinion enough with the over the top bloviation btw where was all this indignation about the individual mandate when the republicans and the heritage foundation were pushing it as their big idea several years ago rs are all about personal responsiblity except when they aren't same with state's rights and federalism
710602756,why are people treating this like a big aha story anyone who knows anything about political strategy understands that one prepares for all imaginable contingencies which is why the rs have been reported to be working on legislation for this summer dismantling pieces of the aca anticipating that the court may uphold parts or all of the law both sides are doing exactly what one would expect this really is a duh moment
710602756,pauldog obama has an automatic vote from union thugs occupiers welfare queens far left anarchists blacks and the huge percentage who pay no income taxes why rock the boat
710602756,if the scotus dumps the mandate the whole law collapses anyway
710602756,too funny for words
710602756,the big fat gloriously wealthy slob michael moore oh yes i believe every thing the communist pig says
710602756,why do you bother joe you cannot live on the cents soros pays you and you are convincing no one
710602756,apparently the ones who wrote the ppaca didn't understand it either kay if you think obama is the greatest president ever you have a few screws loose of course most leeches do think he is great he gives the taxpayer's money away to them
710602756,no the whole law doesn't collapse unless the court finds that the insurance provisions are not severable from the rest of the law almost half the law has nothing to do with insurance rather it concerns itself with improving quality of care shoring up the healthcare workforce creating forums to explore evidence based best practices for providing healthcare creating incentives for providers to coordinate your care so you aren't shuttled from one to the other to the other with no one seeming to know what is happening these are the kinds of things that one would imagine the average joe or jane would be for holding providers and hospitals and others accountable for the care that we are paying for and trying to squeeze more value out of those health care dollars no matter what your position is about the insurance coverage parts of the law why would you want these innovations to fail
710602756,what's next kay i'm waiting for you to yell heil obama next
710602756,why would he do that since pelosi said supreme court will vote
710602756,obama has revealed to donors that he could have to revise parts of the policy in a second term this is my last election after my election i have more flexibility president obama whether selling out us security or revising obamacare these are good reasons to not re elect him
710602756,you sound like one of those constant complainers that i run into at the va all they do is criticize condemn and complain piss and moan i'm sick of jerk offs like you you haven't a clue what you are talking about so stfu
710602756,eye roll and that douche bag michael moore depicts cuba's filthy dismal health care system as the gold standard please go back to the drawing board you need a real reference
710602756,no way commie in cheif there aint gona be no national health care private sector only
710602756,don't worry we'll take care of it for you pages of garbage will make great confetti in time for the football season
710602756,yes but in their hurry to pass something queen nancy and king harry forgot to add a severability clause so the whole law goes down in flames and republicans will do nothing to save it
710602756,you are comp etely corrrent about the absence of a severability clause but that apparently isn't dispositive of the issue why would the court appoint a third party amicus to submit briefs and present a case on precisely this point during oral arguments it suggests that they are at least considering it or they would have dispensed with it out of hand at the beginning not even have accepted it for arguments who knows what will happen but it still seems to be on the table and we'll just have to see what the court does with it all these great legal minds on this comment board notwithstanding
710602756,hey peeeelosi if it is ironclad then why wont it be ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
710602756,a year who will receive subsidies for their health insurance premiums subsidies that will be borrowed and have to be paid back by your children the millions using the health clinics set up by the plan and paid for by who borrowed again let everyone in america consume more than they produce for ever look to europe to see where that takes you those who are now getting free preventive care on their health insurance without a co payment but it's not free there is no free in economics the insurance company raises your rate to cover it if you pay for your own insurance you are paying for the free if you employer pays for your insurance you still pay for the free by not getting a raise in your take home pay get the government out of my insurance let me purchase the coverage i want let me purchase what i want from whom i want i want to purchase insurance to cover the illness or accident that i cannot afford to pay myself i don't want to purchase prepaid healthcare i want to purchase insurance but americans are too poorly educated to even understand the difference
710602756,bemused correct the difference is when obama came into office he identified the need to fix healthcare but chose to do it by using the crisis to bestow a new entitlement to millions magical thinking and accounting made it save billions on paper he allowed his party to run the bill through congress without leadership except granting favors for votes and excluded both republicians and physicians from the process the key to why its now a court matter is the mandate and its penalties for political reasons the democrats decided not to use the word tax in defining the law to avoid rightful tax and spend label but now are afoul of the constitution republicians still like personal responsibility the mandate is the right idea but the structure is wrong the reason that the scotus will vote down the law my belief is congress just picked the wrong formula for the mandate call it a tax make all workers pay like ss or medicare and presto its constitutional oh and those congresspeople who did vote for it did get the resentment they lost their seats in again my opinion if the president had said to dely implementation of the bill for or more years and was willing to bring back to congress some of the hotly debated elements he would be much better positioned for reelection sadly he doubled down on class warefare instead
710602756,the best way to demonstrate public outrage or public celebration about the decision is to stage an event that shows average people actually responding to the news the memo read they intend to spend money borrowed from china to convince us that it just ain't so with a puppet show that will be spread via a mainstream media that has proved itself to have little integrity this is planned propaganda we'll see nothing but wailing and gnashing of teeth progressive style this endless wasteful spending won't stop until these deniers are voted out
710602756,be your not bemused your liberal which is ok i guess but serious issues need more than emotion and your feelings to find answers as to the question when the case was sent to the scotus the adminestration wished it wouldn't come up til after the election at the time both nancy ann depearl wh health czar and hhs sec sebeluis said there would be no contingency planning because as ms pesosi said they were confident that the law was consitiutional because hey we won reference to election results pointed out to republicians during the bills debate allowed them to create this signature legislation
710602756,he wants a second term on healthcare is he delusional what about the darn economy and jobs
710602756,be while some of the ideals you list are desireable do you really think massive government rules and holding someone else accountable for your healthcare is the best approach and do you really believe it will make it any less costly the government and more regulation are not the answer as a country we overuse healthcare and suffer the ills of having someone else pay for it you hit the nail on the head with your st post it is personal responsibility if this really were about care recieved why didn't obama have a few doctors behind closed doors to work on the bill why was the service emplyoees union president trumka at the white house a dozen times during the debate
710602756,i want obama and pelosi what you said
710602756,michael moore hahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahaha
710602756,we don't want your freaking obamacare period prep all you want cause when romney becomes president he will flush your damn obamacare down the commode
710602756,you sound like a government employee or at least someone who thinks that the average joe or jane can't take care of themselves as regards to getting the right health care government out of our lives would be nice women for romney
710602756,do you include yourself in the group of great legal minds
710602756,whether or not scotus torpedoes the whole bill it has the power to one reason that it could is that the democrats scurrying like rats in the night to shove this monstrosity through forgot to include a severability clause so because of that mistake simply striking down the mandate has the effect of striking down the whole law it was a rookie bonehead mistake by the democrats
710602756,prep all you want there barry cause now you don't have mother hubbard pelosi running roughshod over the house and poor old old old harry lost his majority to rational senators but we know you progressives will keep on trying once you get fixated on a crazy idea you wear it to the bone
710602756,get over yourself women for romney
710602756,if i had a dog he would look like cisco
710602756,obama will revise but it will be in chicago where he again can signup more negros for welfare the end
710602756,another pseudo intellectual leftist enough with the pomposity the over the top bloviation is being done by you
710602756,sorry obozo you will not get a second chance to continue your war against the american people you better get in as many free vacations that you can between now and the end of the year because your time on the american peoples payroll is nearing it's end good riddance
710602756,actually she does he was her constitutional law professor
710602756,i thought it was odd that he took all of his guests phones and pdas before he gave this little pep talk to his dwindling number of sheeple
710602756,i do not want my kids living with me or staying on my health insurance till age
710602756,what a crock it must be a nice view from this megalomaniacs perch
710602756,darrell issa must investigate this immediately if true this is an absolute outrage and possibly outside the rule of law
710602756,more time wasted on a horrible bill while neglecting unemployment nobama in nov someone tell barack we are baroke
710602756,sounds like the folks at this dinner was smoking some of obama's wacky weed this nightmare of a bill was shoved down our throats now obama and his minion are making regulation after regulation that they say comes from the bill since i have read that bill times i can say that these regulations did not come from that bill
710602756,unfortunately the pres doesn't get it we don't want your government run health care it has not worked in any country where its been tried what makes anyone think it will work here we have the best health care system in the world right now why is it that democrats feel compelled to take it over and screw it up they can't deliver letters what makes the government bureaucrats think that the can deliver babies or remove appendexes or anything else leave that which ain't broke alone
710602756,what is ironclad is her brain if she has one under that frozen smile
710602756,well said well said
710602756,and my health insurance rates have already doubled in the past year thanks to those parts of obamacare which have gone into effect and when the rest of it kick in it will be time to start looking for the nearest poor house or jail because no one will be able to afford the premiums which they must pay or be prosecuted for failure to to have the health insurance i can no longer afford thanks to the government which is anxious to prosecute me for failure to buy that which they said i must freedom democrat style in the meantime the federal bureaucrats are having parties in vegas doing hot tubs with wine and visitors living high on my hog
710602756,yep obama ignores jobs by focusing on rationed mandated obamadeathcare and 'stimulating his pals with our money and today's unemployment numbers reflect that but since he wants to kill as many jobs as possible so more people depend on him he doesn't mind he's just surprised people don't believe him anymore when he keeps blaming you know who
710602756,it doesn't matter to him what the courts rule or what the people have to say all that matters to him is what he wants and he will let nothing stand in his way to get what he wants not the american people courts constitution or anything else
710602756,go ahead gop and the supreme death panel take away the health care benefits from the millions who are already getting them from the patient protection and affordable care act and find out what happens in november

710602756,this rule about being under the parent's insurance until age is to start them off on the democratic life of dependency on the government that way they will always vote for the welfare party of leeches
710602756,if you don't see the importance of this election and the stark differences unlike any other election in the past then you have been living under a rock this is good vs evil and the marxist dictator obama needs to go home to stir things up in his thugland chicago
710602756,we will have a new president rommey the american people don't want this health care bill as far as the rest of the democrats many will be looking for work after nov
710602756,every woman has the right to abort her daughter simply because she exists if she didn't exist there'd be no need for an abortion here today gone tomorrow into a red medical waste bin no funeral no flowers no prayers karma will have the final word obama you will not prevail no chance in hell you already know you're going down sonia tipped ya off the 'infant in the white house is going downnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

710602756,you would rather they did not have health insurance like millions of others do you have any idea how many work where there is no health insurance
710602756,second term what are they still smoking
710602756,not really the insurers would likely get squeezed as healthy people dropped coverage knowing that they could get insured later that might actually lead to the government proposing rescues of health insurers that amount to single payer
710602756,you gotta put your head where the sun shines bozo have you ever heard the phrase there ain't no such thing as a free lunch you've been bragging about all the benefits which will accrue to the recipients of obamacare just where do you think the money to pay for them is coming bozo eg government declares that the insurance companies must accept people with preexisting illnesses but not increase the policy holder's premium because of it who is gonna pay for it bozo why the people who already have insurance with that insurance company their rates go up bozo parents can keep their children on their health insuranace policy until they are but the insurance companies cannot charge an additional premium for the children's coverage who does pay for it mr bozo the current policy holders including those who have no children at home age and under that's who bozo their rates go up bozo just as have mine and hundreds of thousands of others why do you think obamacare is so unpopular bozo because contrary to the pie in the sky promises made by obama the reality is that for all the goodies packed into the bill someone must pay for them and our insurance rates have gone up astronomically bozo because of the mandates in obamacare stop listening to those who are lying to you bozo because i know from first hand expeirence how expensive obamacare has been to me and can only wonder how much worse its going to get when the painful provisions in the act that the democrats and obama pushed off to take effect after the election take effect bozo thing might even smell a little better when you get your head where the sun shines bozo
710602756,repealing obamacare won't take any medical care away from anybody people will continue to be treated when needed just as they were before obamacare people who can't afford treatment will be aided by medicaid which could have already been expanded to cover the uninsured as part of a targeted incremental reform instead we're grappling with a mammoth infrastructure going up at lightening speed and gobbling up billions of dollars along the way to suck up and store enough medical files to keep hhs cdc nih social services the schools police and government managers frolicking happily in data for decades to come what's expanding here isn't healthcare it's the it sector good thing john ashcroft won't be attorney general he'd be able to data mine for abortion records in about seconds peace out
710602756,he would have to revise areas of the law in a second term yet another reason why he should not be re elected
710602756,what an idiot get out into the real world
710634418,lol team obama is sinking fast and can't seem to find a flotation device anywhere their campaign is the best comedy routine running right now d
710640686,when you surround yourself with idiots you become one obama corzine transparent bankrupt
710640686,the smartest man in the world who thinks there are states and that nazi's and pole's are synonymous will probably jump out of air force one with a back pack any day now
710640686,shrugged it off a couple days ago now his world is crashing down around him and he is repentant sure don't believe him
710640686,gosh for the smartest man that ever lived he sure does make the same kind mistakes that d student would make i guess we know now why we can't see his college transcripts
710640686,next we'll have obama writing on the blackboard times i will proofread all my speechwriters' scripts from now on
710640686,he also insulted the poles because he refused to let lech walesa sp accept the medal of freedom reward in that ceremony a double insult to good people
710640686,from the outhouse to the white house to the apology house
710640686,nobody cares about poland which accepted bribes from bush to participate in his illegal invasion of iraq in spite of opposition from its citizens
710640686,obama biden
710640686,the smartest man in the world is mit professor noam chomsky and he knows there are states moron
710640686,remember when we had a president that could act the ipod incident august dear president obama it seems like a lifetime ago considering the economy is being shoved off a cliff by your backward not a snowballs chance in hell of working economic policy while you simultaneously grab the parachutes off of americas collective back the grinding free fall is becoming a reality for most in a world of depleted savings and little reward for work other then survival soon after your assuming the throne you called on the queen of england then you presented her majesty with an ipod full of your speeches being a little bit of an audiophile i ve still got a reel to reel player and a record player in my vast collection i have speeches from the most pivotal moments in recorded history churchill fdr the bombing of pearl harbor and much more of course i have an ipod too and on it i have a bunch of speeches on that like the ones that reagan delivered after his state landslide and the one he gave so presciently and with great vigor in there is a vast chasm between you and president reagan to understand this all one needs to hear is the response of the crowd to his nomination acceptance speech in detroit michigan to absorb the wisdom humility and love of country that mr reagan held you see mr obama men like president reagan believed in what they were saying with their heart soul and mind men like mr reagan understood that the american people had been suckered in the past and they deserved the service of an american that would serve genuinely without pretense or false witness mr obama do you know what it means when a person has to speak in low tones or can t say one speech to every audience whether it is new york city or houston texas or minot air force base it means they are practicing the art of obfuscation because in their heart in your heart mr obama you know that if you told the whole truth and nothing but the truth your entire world would come crashing down president reagan earned the respect of the american people by holding himself and frankly us to a standard and a hope that we would once again see america as a shining beacon of liberty to all who seek her shores mr obama i hope that one day you grow enough to earn our respect i do not believe that there is a soul on this earth who can t decide that tomorrow is the day they do the right thing including you yet the evidence for this opportunity is diminishing by the week with every opportunity you have had to promote and celebrate what makes america so special you blew and as i think sinatra once said not in a small way if president reagan were alive today he would be ashamed of what you have done thus far he would be doing everything in his power to rally americans to defeat you and your ilk at the ballot box since he is not here it will be my honor our honor to try to do it for him respectfully joe doakes
710640686,apostrophes are never used to pluralize a word dum dum
710640686,like i said joe when you surround yourself with idiots you become one
710640686,noam chomsky is a failed simplistic leftist who is embittered by the fall of the soviet union
710640686,what's sad is the resistance from obama to issue an apology in the first place this man child just has absolutely no sensitivity to others feelings a sickness of the mind and soul
710640686,the obama administration foreign policy stupidity continues even after the firing of dennis ross and george mitchell he talks over god save the queen he insults the jewish faith with a microphone left on he promises putin he will have more flexibility after he is re elected again with a microphone left on etc etc etc
710640686,you are incorrect poland was instrumental in the fall of the soviet union and the economic foolishness of marxism and many many people the world over including here in the us care about it
710640686,first his remarks are downplayed as brouha ha then the wh makes some phony half hearted apology now a formal letter of apology this president is an idiot apparently he doesn't accept protocol briefings from the state department or ask them to review his speechwriters transcripts crude and rude
710640686,the chicago polish population see's that the democrats say one thing and do another just watching democrat leaders in illinois assault all their beloved unions over wages healthcare and pensions is music to my ears because it exposes them as the two faced liars that they are
710640686,obama should apologize in writing to the ameriacn public for being a pathetic president
710640686,ill give him credit for this doesnt show well for harvard though that he wasnt taught correctly or his prompter loader that he didnt know the correct phraseeology
710640686,to reiterate what astrophysics said reagan and the pope funneled money into poland to help the outlawed non government solidarity movement banned by the soviets with reagan forcing the soviets to spread themselves so thin everywhere else they lost their grasp on poland until reagan finished them off comepletely so you can make light of poland but i won't since all the mur and mayem they went through not to mention our democrat parties big hero stalin who murdered thousands of polish soldiers and buried them in the woods remember that
710640686,obama will proff read his teleprompter lol
710640686,demcrat rosevelt concedes poland to unckle joe stalin when ww ever ended stalin executes polish soldiers and undesireables and buries them in the katyn forrest in russia republican reagan with the help of the pope funnels money into poland in the 's to help the outlawed solidarity movement against the soviets reagan forcees the soviets to redistribute soldiers out of poland where they lose thier grasp until reagan finishes them off completely idiot democrat obama spits on poland attributing the death camps to them as a fan of mao and stalin what do you expect
710640686,i do not think that obazo can afford to make any more enemies along with the horrible job he is doing as prez he needs to remember to think before he opens his big mouth yes the same mouth that yells out all the lies and bull you guys listened to before you cast your vote i can not believe you couldn't see through the the lies he always tells
710640686,are you declaring that obama and biden will be up for election to collect garbage i'd vote for that
710640686,again i ask will someone please show at least one piece of evidence that this guy is an intellectual i know you democrats will site the dying economy he's created in some convoluted way but c'mon he's such an embarassing idiot and excuse me if i mispelled anything here i wasn't using my teleprompter
710640686,sincerity just takes a number of days to dredge up
710640686,this was clearly the fault of bush who sabotaged the teleprompter using a form of mind control that space aliens taught him when he visited area when he was president
710640686,obama is not very bright he is a product of affirmative action
710640686,ironic that you nitpick the pluralization of the word nazi
710640686,wow you are truly brainwashed
710640686,yes president obama had been waiting all his life for this moment he would put together this ceremony give this medal and then stick it to poland he obviously has been planning this since his days in muslim school in kenya mission accomplished geez folks i mean really
710640686,perfect material for letterman's great moments in presidential speeches'
710640686,yes bush used a haliburton made teleprompter text occiliator device cheney gave him for just this occasion that's a good excuse as any for the liberals to use to explain the idiot in chief's gaffe obama even screws up on the teleprompter
710640686,he's extremely arrogant and looks down his nose to other people how's that for a piece of evidence that he's an intellectual
710640686,and yet another fine post from a great american joe doakes
710640686,trail of gaffes follows this chicago hustler where ever he and his partner joe biden go
710640686,even though it is above their qualifications but we still have affirmative action
710640686,likely since it was his 'people' that founded communism etc
710640686,next obama will be babbling about the kenyian death camps
710640686,what a stupid monkey we have not to mention his three chimps soon the nigg ers will be out of office and our country will be well on her way to be great again
710640686,no nobody cares about what you say joe or whoever you are today
710640686,just as mi guel resp onded i am ins pired that pe ople can earn in we eks on the comp uter did you rea d this we b si te c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710640686,your vocabulary leaves a lot to be desired
710640686,f off pal you must be a democrat plant because a republican wouldn't talk like that the deocrats patronizing then ignoring of african americans until election time is proof of that
710640686,i'm shocked shocked that president obama admitted to making an error which caused anguish to millions of polish people by apologizing in 'writing' there is no video of him admitting to a mistake which is the most important thing in this whole matter i doubt if he could have carried off a sincere apology in front of a video camera
710640686,you got me there i guess he's been hanging out with liz warren and paul krugman two other often quoted idio i mean intellectuals
710640686,he should of just blamed bush he does for everything else
710640686,hey folks can someone anyone explain to me why it took days for obama to write his apology to the polish nation arrogance or ignorance
710640686,bill clinton was correct obama should be getting someone coffee tea or a cold beer the next negro in the white house will be doing just that and they said they couldn't play qb in the nfl so true
710640686,i think this is what obama refers to as a teachable moment' and in this case obama is the student but not really a failure in his eyes since he is incapable of error he apologizes for the over sensitivity of the polish people to well intended remarks
710640686,in referring to a polish death camp' rather than a nazi death camp in german occupied poland ' i inadvertently obama should have said stupidly' used a phrase that has caused many poles anguish over the years and that poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world obama wrote i regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth
710640686,when is obama going to apologize to the american people for embarrassing our country
710640686,president pothead needs to apologize to the american people for his widley unpopular socialistic policies like obozocare the lack of jobs a crappy economy and making millions of people slaves on the liberal plantation through wekfare food stamps and unemployment
710640686,the real teachable moment is what scott walker is doing in wisconsin to turn thier economy around while creating and saving jobs not raising taxes inticing companies to move there with lower taxes and already creating surplus but the student obama keeps cutting class to smoke weed behind the gym
710640686,obama the embarrassment in the white house he does not do amercia any favors by being there maybe it's the pot cocaine and heavy use of alcohol thru the years that has affected his brain
710640686,can anybody even imagine the media shrieks if romney or bush had made this gaffe it would have been front page lead story news for days as it is since he's their anointed one and incapable of making mistakes that get noticed there has been scarcely a ripple in the pro obama nyt wp abc cbs or nbc media pond
710640686,again obama is apologizing to yet another foriegn country again did he bow this time also did he grovel crawl lick the polish leader shoes what a disgrace obama is what a no balls patheticly embarrassing excuse for an american president november can not come soon enough
710640686,tell me how errors purported and otherwise by bush not to mention clinton before him somehow absolves obama of his own mistakes and pray tell how this all relates to an ignorant comment about polish history no doubt written by one of obama's speech writers and read off the prompter by obama
710640686,here are a few more obama quotes ignored by the media today i m pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office feb you ve had an honorable man a decent man an honest man at the helm of this state one of the things you ve got in jon corzine is somebody who tells it to you straight oct if an individual mandate was the solution we could try that to solve homelessness by mandating everybody to buy a house candidate obama feb algae you've got a bunch of algae out here if we can figure out how to make energy out of that we'll be doing alright feb if somebody wants to build a coal powered plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted jan i believe marriage is between a man and a woman i am not in favor of gay marriage candidate obama i promise to close guantanamo you get to keep the doctor and health plan you have i don't deserve to be president in years if i haven't turned this thing around you get to keep the doctor and health plan you have
710640686,the police behaved stupidly he couldn't get a medal of honor winner's name correct he's insulted the poles first by betraying them to the russians on missile defense and now by refusing to let lech walesa the hero of solidarity attend the ceremony and then insulting every living pole with this polish death camp nonsense obama clearly has no sense of history does nobody in the white house know anything and today we were treated witht the news that unemployment is going back up and obama's failed policies and presidency are pushing our nation back into recession how much more of obama do we have to take folks nov can't get here soon enough
710640686,sorry fella i don't like the president's politics but i don't appreciate the gratuitous racial comments by you either i know it feels good to vent but you do the conservative cause great harm when you make such comments
710640686,obama needed to apologize this time to poland he screwed the pooch himself and apologized for what he said instead of apologizing for what americans do poland is one of our closest foreign friends and his statement needed to be apologized for i don't agree with the bowing to other leaders and stupid ignorant comments he makes about his own citizens to the rest of the world but this time i feel it was rightly due
710640686,c'mon this is sensitivity carried to absurd lengths there's not a person in the entire world who sincerely thinks that barack obama believes that auschwitz and other concentration camps located in poland were created and staffed by poles we all understand that sometimes even the most careful public speaker blows his lines mr obama blew that line he duly apologized as any gentleman would this is not exactly an important story don't poles have something more significant to anguish over
710640686,no when the most powerful person in the world reads a prewritten speech that he approved of and says that the nazi's and stalin's mass murders are actually their fault you have to call him on it especially if he's president of the joe stalin fan club like obama is
710640686,lol he didn't say it was their fault you're funny
710640686,jobs were added maybe unemployment went up because more people have started looking for work again
710640686,the joe stalin fan club oh i think i've heard about them don't they have a big shindig at disney world every year
710640686,the workforce grows by about people a month just with general growth of the population adding jobs is pathetic that doesn't even accommodate the new people in the workforce let alone the discouraged who have given up looking for work labor force participation is at its lowest rate in years yet obama's signature program is a health insurance mandate that makes employing people more expensive energy is more expensive for employers due to green power and the attack on coal the epa is regulating everything in sight and obama who has never run a business and never been an employer of anything except civil servants paid by someone else has no clue how jobs are created that's why unemployment is up
710640686,no he went to muslim school in indonesia
710640686,no their shindig moves this year it's in charlotte nc
710640686,if you're going to try that approach then he has to count the million who stopped looking and put them back into the unemployment rate putting it over
710640686,he's not a conservative the democratic super pacs are paying staff to pose as conservatives and write racist remarks so they can keep the whole racism meme alive
710640686,this is standard chicago political tactics the demoncrats super pacs are paying people to pose as conservatives and post racist garbage
710640686,obama's bowing etiquette manual states thus arab or muslin yes bow jews or christian no bow enemies of the state yes boy allies of the greatest generation no bow hollywood scum yes bow read the book it is full ow witty and heart happy stories
710640686,he be dumber den a sack o' nails
710640686,a more accurate headline would read obama plays golf while a staffer writes then rubber stamps the apology letter for the gaffe regarding polish death camps
710640686,while i think obama made an honest mistake one has to ask the question what words were on the teleprompter the situation would be no big deal if obama hadn't already hung the poles out to dry on missile defense obama were willing to just step forward and utter the words i'm sorry like a human would instead he had a staffer craft a statement of regret and made sure not to have those words come out of his mouth it's about like saying i'm sorry if you were offended
710640686,he never will but if he did he would have a staffer draft a statement delivered at pm on friday night saying i regret that some americans are offended by my efforts to repair foreign relations damaged by my predecessor that would be his definition of an apology
710640686,this is one gaffe that wasn't swept under the rug like the states corpse man selma alabama i see fallen heroes etc it takes people like poles who are not beholden to him to broadcast the truth about obama
710640686,had obama been a real statesman he would not have to make yet another apology to a country for his ignorance of history and inability to read the teleprompter if it isn't an apology for america and our actions of the past its the gaffe's he makes just trying to talk really one of our proudest moments as our representative of america dumb ass
710640686,president obama is not the st to misspeak common sense tell polish jews and all others it was mistake and certainly not his views he's the potus he sincerely apologized
710640686,so has he apologized to the austrians for saying they spoke austrian or to the queen for giving her an ipod of his speeches the left keeps telling us how smart obama is they also like to claim other former presidents were dumb funny how they all went to the same schools and we know their grades and their thesis but not obama what proof do we have that obama is smart i haven't seen him do one smart thing all day
710640686,of course he wouldn't have needed to apologize if he had any sort of grounding in world history from his various quips and gaffes it's apparent that he never was exposed to american or world history in school that poland has been one of our allies for awhile makes this an important saving face moment for someone who is alleged to be smart he doesn't show it too often
710640686,corpsemen beer summits cash for clunkers no no i have been practicing i bowled a it's like it was like special olympics or something making an off hand joke during an appearance on the tonight show march obama later called the head of the special olympics to apologize what i was suggesting you're absolutely right that john mccain has not talked about my muslim faith in an interview with abc's george stephanopoulos who jumped in to correct obama by saying your christian faith which obama quickly clarified we're the country that built the intercontinental railroad cincinnati oh sept ups and fedex are doing just fine right it's the post office that's always having problems attempting to make the case for government run healthcare while simultaneously undercutting his own argument portsmouth n h aug gosh there are so many more while the left continues to run on the blame bush strategy there's no way that the media wouldn't have crucified bush had he made this same unending list of mistakes for the smartest guy in the world this seems to refute his claims
710640686,of course that's what always cracked me up about the leftist's attacks on bush almost in the same sentence they would say he was stupid but that he masterminded a machiavellian scheme of some sort i don't know how long these liberals can keep grasping at straws
710640686,the real irony is this the city with the largest polish ethnic group outside of warsaw poland is chicago now while poles don't hold the same sort of political cachet as hispanics african americans and lgbt groups for this president they are third and fourth generation entrenched members of the democrat party in that region i know because my husband is from there and his family has been involved in democrat politics for years in fact we were warned by one of his cousins who is a former mayor of one of the suburbs that obama was trouble and that he was being pushed through by powerful people in direct opposition to mainstream members these groups are mad they will stay home what irony would it be if the prez lost illinois there are forces downstate that are trying to martial enough votes to counter the chicago vote i don't think they can do it but it would be good to see a few long time congressmen toppled
710640686,biden ted baxter
710640686,i'm sure some paid staffer crafted the letter and valerie jarrett rubber stamped the signature at no time did any paper admitting failure touch the one's hands
710640686,dear poland and her proud people please forgive the nitwit that is currently occupying our oval office he is classless insensitive and undoubtedly not qualified for the position please accept our apologies and be assured he will be replaced next by an adult who has both class and manners
710640686,obo proves daily that you can't buy class
710640686,this from the guy who thought there were states i don't think he knows his history or geography
710640686,kind of similar to the moveable nuremberg rally that's due in tampa soon isn't it
710640686,the verbal gaffe calling it a polish death camp was one simple insult but the much bigger insult was to deny lech walensa the nobel peace prize winner labor leader and previous medal of freedom winner as a suitable pole to receive karski's posthumous award of the medal of freedom this stupid ignotant communist moron would not allow this famous and polish hero as conqueror of communism entry to his leftist white house as the designated receiver of the medal at the last minugte a minor polish embassy functionary had to substitute for the polish government's and polish hero as designated receiver that is the rea swupreme l and unforgiveable polish insult
710640686,he thought there were even righties can't get the story straight he is a history buff but he is not perfect as you and i are
710640686,blah blah blah the nitwit will be reelected because the other dude is really not qualified for the position
710640686,oh not another birther are you watching him all day every day might try bowling
710640686,you never fail to surprise me by your stupidity what a hoot surprised you didn't say lenin or marxist but you brought up comrade joe big time i don't think he said the mass murders are actually their fault being rather melodramatic
710640686,haaaa stuff it rightwingers you need to blame someone for your miserable life so blame obama
710640686,omg where are my two books of bushisms i knew they were reference worthy blame bush you blame obama everyone needs to blame someone had bush made mistakes so funny let us count the ways
710640686,at least aren't leaving the job market each month as in under what's his name that no one wants to hear mentioned for every month that what's his name lost jobs obama should have to recover jobs given that the house is tied and gagged and won't be released until they get a jobs bill out what's his name gets credit for million jobs in years
710640686,lmao almost four years and you still haven't caught on that your emperor has no clothes i blame your teachers
710640686,people who can't own up and apologize are weak you obviously just don't like him so if he didn't apologize you'd be criticizing him for that he did the right thing and i respect him more for it in dictatorships the rulers never apologize everything is always perfect and any blunders regrets anything to hide is swept under the rug you may have more respect for north korea's leader
710640686,well he went to law school for one if you left the country you would see how people of europe were in shock that americans would re elect a dope like bush who not only made the occasional gaffe but looked like a town drunk ruling a nation only the weak can't own up and apologize obama is not ideal but i definitely find him intelligent
710640686,all i can say is that i freelance in the photo industry and i'm working almost as much as i was years ago as the first thing cut from budgets is usually advertising i really felt the recession and i've been feeling it pick back up i can now consider buying property because it's not inflated anymore from back when bush allowed the banks to run wild with bidding on mortgages etc my peers my employers and my clients all have noticed an upswing for a while now something is happening that is way better than the mess that was left behind after our tax money yours too was being blown on starting a war that made no sense whatsoever a failed businees opportunity for bush's wealthy contractor friends to rebuild a nation and grab some oil while they're at it how can people be so critical of obama's gaffe which he was man enough to apologize for and deny that our last president started wars senseless ones it's crazy to me you vote so much on matters that don't matter that don't change our lives really listen to both candidates and see what makes sense
710640686,the ignorance of obama his 'speech writers' handlers puppeteers is stunning shocking we knew obama was not the genius he purported to be not the 'savior' 'healer' non partisan he pretended to be but at least we believed he'd be smart enough to surround himself with those who had some understanding knowledge of history the big wide world this shameful faux pas is reason enough to send obama back to chi town let alone the disastrous mess he's made of our economy our international standing in the world this kind of ignorance is not just embarrassing but is very very dangerous in the world we live in today time to end the error of obama
710640686,nobody is perfect only north korea's leader of course he never makes mistakes neither did stalin bush never started a war well maybe he did but that wasn't a mistake was it it like made our country a lot of money and our per household in taxes that went to the war well we were all happy to pay it to kill those people over there everything was perfect then we need to amend the constitution to re elect bush
710640686,i wouldn't use him as an example for that you're a jerk you could use some affirmative action to get you an education
710640686,prior to his speech obama received payment by german influenced congress you can find that on your own since there was not an official white house press conference in regards to that on tv most americans won't know it's not the first time it happen believe me it only gives another excuse for jewish propaganda machine to blame poles have you seen obama apologize for that on tv i did not it wasn't a mistake
710640686,it was not an error nor lack of th grade student's knowledge of history after all he has educated staff that writes speeches for him prior to his mistake obama received from german influenced congress you can find that out online it was featured on polish tv it only gives another excuse to jewish propaganda to blame poles not mentioning that it was done by german nazis i did not hear obama apologize on cnn did you
710643450,all those who say the administration is cooking the books when the job numbers are good will have to explain how this report got out
710643450,barry is toast
710643450,obamanomics does not work because obamanomics's goal is to get people not to work and to be on welfare
710643450,wow what confidence america has in the president loser policies doing absolutely nothing for america no talk of taxmageddon debt deficit social security or medicare but tons of trash talk about romney who actually has run a business and knows about economics this loser is done in november
710643450,looks like another summer recovery gone bad again obama economics fails again the recovery will start when mitt becomes president
710643450,obama jobs unemployment hope and change is offically ended can you say prez romney
710643450,i'm sure the jobs number will be revised down next month like it has of the last months the real unemployment rate of over is not talked about
710643450,the haters love this
710643450,it's bush's fault
710643450,oh please cry baby is that all you have our so called 'hate pales compared to what you and your vile people feel and act on hypocritical ass
710643450,no more mincing words the bottom line that the media is blatantly and purposefully ignoring is that the republican party is on a sabotage mission against the american economy every single action taken and word spoken by mitt romney john boehner and every republican in congress is designed to kill as many jobs as possible by the election it's that simple and that disgusting these traitors are thrilled with such bleak numbers because they know that their master plan is working how are we supposed to grow the economy when the gop is threatening fiscal disaster at every turn and refusing to cooperate with policies that actually create jobs something needs to be done www sunstateactivist org
710643450,not really it just shows more failure from the administration but feel real sorry for the millions of the unemployed
710643450,april and may together didnt add up to the expectation for may alone
710643450,dear barack obama thank you for replacing me as the worst president in the last half century your friend in failure jimmy carter
710643450,good thing that i liquidated the majority of my portfolio in may it is only going to get worse until bozo is gone reminds me of jimmy carter but at least he had a real job before becoming president
710643450,year treasury at plunge
710643450,fire his butt
710643450,does this pathetic number surprise anyone employers are holding off on hiring until the election obamacare is in limbo the epa passes new job killing regulations on a near daily basis team obama clearly have no understanding of capitalism and free enterprise and if obama wins reelection in november hiring won't occur at all
710643450,this is the result of the spike in gas prices earlier this year the uncertainty caused businesses to change their plans obama's cry that there was little he could do to lower gas prices merely added to the uncertainty this is so much a replay of the carter era come the fall he'll be advising us to turn down our thermostats and wear sweaters
710643450,unemployment went up because more people are entering the workforce the exact opposite of what you bitch ass repubs were complaining about weeks ago republicans rooting for american to fail since january
710643450,the only thing that is missing at this point is for obama to start wandering around the whitehouse in tan sweaters and begin talking about economic malaise
710643450,obozo does not want people working for a living he needs them to be on the welfare rolls that's his voter base
710643450,u is actually up as well at refutes your claim since u reports underemployed as well
710643450,now listen to the stupid romney gop comments they advocate triple h b they support current millions of legal immigrants guest workers and students since romney and gop are liars when they say they want to help workers liars
710643450,even they couldn't cook the books enough to cover up a fuster cluck this big the real number proably should have been
710643450,bushes have and on worst presidents since lbj
710643450,obama f uck you pos go mitt
710643450,who to blame now obozo cloward piven keep 'em dependent on gov't
710643450,what even your own bureau of labor statistics couldn't fudge the numbers enough for you most american's realized that the books had been cooked and weren't buying those inflated numbers anyway but it finally got so bad that they won't cover for you anymore look for more defections by prominent democrats your house of cards is collapsing obama is such a bad president that he has rehabilitated george w bush in coming years we will hear the name carter much less that slam will be replaced with the name of obama thank you mr president for providing both excellent shorting opportunities and stocks on sale for those with a long term investment strategy
710643450,year treasury rate this morning year treasury rate today stunning not good it's the economy stupid a wake up call for the administration time for the new team to come in
710643450,and what this is somehow news americans are all fully aware that the jobs market is bleek and has been for the past almost years what would be the right thing to do and the right thing to report would be to report the true unemployment numbers which we know are upward to rather than skewing numbers and making it appear that the job market is getting better media credibility is zilch when you report skewed numbers and use smoke and mirrors and blow sunshine up our backsides to make the appearance that things are better than they really are
710643450,only in wackjob liberal msnbc land most real american's know that carter was much worse than bush i or ii and obama is well on his way
710643450,there is hope for this country anybody that would vote for obama at this point is just damn stupid at best the magic negro is done goodbye you pos
710643450,numbers do not lie moron
710643450,delusional numbers do not lie
710643450,buh bye fool
710643450,what day do they do the revision down to a job loss number
710643450,it shows how unqualified and stupid obama is
710643450,voice of reason bwhahahahahahaha what a pompous jerk people are leaving the workforce retard
710643450,the ss obama is going down
710643450,there is a real angst and anger that our country is in trouble and we need to change course before it is too late shout it from the rooftops obama must go
710643450,maybe they are cooking and it is worse than this
710643450,this is no surprise there was a time in the old america when one could open a business and enjoy it
710643450,yes with the mega number of jobs out there millions are applying for those jobs what a rube
710643450,by what quantifiable measures
710643450,did you fall down and hit your head no wait you are on the public dole never mind
710643450,more of what passes for success under our useless unqualified incompetent nobel prize winning spock like austrian speaking polish death camp memorializing state quoting messiah
710643450,they aren't cooked there is a standard formula used in government for job creation third parties just use a different ones there is no report that accounts for every job that is created individually across the country down to the exact employee
710643450,bs to your whole insipid comment do you live in a bubble or are you some government drone or worse yet some lunatic union drone your comments are just plain stupid
710643450,he's terrified he might have to get a job
710643450,obozo the welfare food stamp whitehouse occupant he has been a sponge his whole life and he thinks that's normal
710643450,obama's cooked books aren't holding up his fantasy economic growth time for him to move on and allow our country to heal
710643450,don't ask a leftie for logic especially one like this retard
710643450,turn out the lights the obama nightmare is just about over as don meredith would say the fat lady is in the tunnel warming up her singing voice things have always been worse than reported but with the koch's and karl rove keeping watch and conservative radio blogs and fox getting the truth out obama can no longer pull the wool over the majority of americans if he thought he could the unemployment rate would have been reported as not even his corrupt administration would dare to do that any longer
710643450,i thought the adjustment recalculated over the succeeding weeks and then published on the following tuesday making it a three week lag from bogus to real
710643450,obama is a wretched failure as a president and as a human being end of discussion
710643450,hope change that is what obama said in well we are still waiting for it do you realize the previous two mos were also revised downward and yesterdays numbers of people going on unemployment went up to and the previouse month was revised upward these goons in obama's administration can be counted on when they give numbers you can bet they will be revised in a negative way the following week or month this country cannot afford four more years of a community organizer that cannto run this country well he can run it but it is not in the interest of the citizens of this country
710643450,no the new bummer sticker is it's the economy and we're not stupid
710643450,look on the bright side wait there isn't one come november there will be tho
710643450,the news might even be worse given chicagoland's habit of manipulating government agencies to get outcomes more to its liking if they can politicize the department of justice why not the bureau of labor statistics
710643450,yet more evidence liberals study liberal arts while the rest of us are enrolled in those nasty old economics courses they don't get it so they rewrite history
710643450,oldatlantic sorry the worst two presdients in this country are carter and obama and know one comes close to them the bushes were a disapointment but do not compare to the above two for the worst in our history
710643450,having a fool for our president certainly hasn't helped it looks like obama needs to call in the choom gang for some ideas btw was nancy pelosi the den mother of this group
710643450,we keep telling you to take your drivel over to msnbc's blog they'd actually agree with you
710643450,john boehner promised jobs if he became speaker of the house of representatives he became speaker in january where are those jobs mr speaker
710643450,unfortunately it's looking like his plan is unfolding even stupid people sometimes stumble on correct action
710643450,yes the whole country is saying the economy is in sewer but more tax cuts won't move the numbers and more debt spending won't move the numbers we have the raw and man made materials but no way to trade them what is an economy i guess an economy is trading things for other things because currency is man made while products are skill knowledge natural resources and services how can we trade in the short term because we know the economy is trading things between local communities trading things between states and trading things between countries we know a big chunk of trade is in gasoline and diesel we know our trading partners in gasoline and diesel need regional stability of the mideast i would work on lowering gasoline prices with reconstruction of poverty in the mideast this will move raw and man made materials out of the global recession countries i would work on lowering household bills by more choice of breaking up cable tv package deals and an option to order menu tv viewing
710643450,hung up and defeated in the democrat controlled senate
710643450,nice try jobs bills passed by the house sitting in harry reid's inbox
710643450,the old chicago way obozo is completely lost in space
710643450,donzi boy we would still be in a mess because obama wants more piople dependent on government checks he wants the number above then in october he is going to a media blitz stating a vote for romney and he will take your government check away from you i do not think it will work because we are not a socialist nation obama and the democrats said that they would not loose another election in years right after the election well obama is killing the democrat party but he had help from reid and pelosi and the black caucus who would follow obama to hell
710643450,you should really be asking harry reid in the senate he is sitting on numerous bills seems he is stalling
710643450,this is not news for those of us in the middle class who live in the real world
710643450,mcconnell and boehner are so proud they have foughtvery hard to keep of us in our place
710643450,there's just no hiding the truth anymore the obama administration has tried everything they can to dress up this economy and it isn't working hopefully the elections this fall will fix this when your re election plan includes bashing the private sector at every turn this is what happens it also doesn't help that private companies are scared to death of the implementation of obamacare obama's only hope now is that the supreme court overturns the entire bill not just the mandate
710643450,here take this towel to cry in
710643450,the house passed jobs bills are in the wastebasket next to harry reid's desk do you not understand that these have to be passed by the senate to be implemented the dems have controlled the senate for at least years
710643450,enough none of them have even been brought up for a vote since dingy knows he might lose
710643450,hoax and chains
710643450,the protesters in boston were right where's the jobs this administration is a bunch of idiots a vote for mitt is a vote for a better economy
710643450,the jobs numbers have been cooked if you have the sense to look at the last two months you will see that they have been revised much lower
710643450,don't worry the liberal media is ready for any spin you can imagine comes election day if the us is at unemployment they will declare it a victory if gasoline is at they will declare it a victory they will not let any bad news hold this president down as romney attacks the obama record he is now being viewed as nasty they want a rerun of the mccain campaign but hopefully romney will stay on the attack romney needs to point out the future under a president obama with four more years and with more flexibility
710643450,yet congress is attempting to pass legislation allowing even more foreign workers into this country what is this total disconnect in washington that they aren't standing up for the american people our own people should come first and if congress doesn't change it's way then it's time to change out congress
710643450,you should really call harry reid he's sitting on numerous jobs bills in the senate why does harry want obama to fail too apparently
710643450,i agree it's just that when job numbers were better a couple of months ago this forum was full of folks saying the numbers were being manipulated if i were manipulating numbers to make myself look good i certainly would have manipulated today's numbers differently also should america be so fortunate as to see improved job numbers in the coming months you can be sure the cooked the book caucus will be back here in force
710643450,here is what obama is doing today while our economy tumbles obama to hold six fundraisers in one day obama will travel to minneapolis where he will ensconce himself at the bachelor farmer restaurant for three successive fundraising events afterward he moves on to chicago for a fundraiser at the chicago cultural center and then two events at what appear to be separate private residences in april obama s fundraising total actually declined by nearly million from the million he took in during march meanwhile romney raised million in april nearly on pace with obama before heading to minneapolis obama will hold an event at the honeywell golden valley facility in golden valley minnesota where he will call on congress to pass his to do list of economic proposals
710643450,i doubt it he'll make the rounds on the speaking circuit and reading off a teleprompter and probably make millions doing so michelle will be the one that has to be dragged out of the white house kicking and screaming
710643450,can you read
710643450,you're not expecting it to get cold this winter are you
710643450,one of these days obama will have to take responsibility for his actions actions that have caused the american economy to tumble you vote for obama you get exactly what you deserve nothing
710643450,you're kidding what can he possible have to say to these people isn't he embarrassed and who is paying money to listen to his nonsense
710643450,one told me to turn my thermostat down and wear a sweater in the winter the other told me to inflate my tires and get a tune up carter obama energy policy need more examples of incompetence
710643450,wh at gl enn sa id i am taken by sur prise that you can make in four weeks on the int ernet ha ve you se en this we bpage c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710643450,quite a recovery from losing a month when obama took office
710643450,translation it's over for the obama biden administration they are now in lame duck status
710643450,take that graph back to a hole
710643450,is that supported by facts please list the monthly numbers and averages to support you contention
710643450,well hell if the sun state activist website whose banner says principled progressive views online says it is true that is good enough for me pretty entertaining reading material i just wish i had my patchouli incense and birkenstocks here in the office
710643450,while suturing a cut on the hand of a year old rancher who's hand wascaught in the gate while working cattle the doctor struck up aconversation with the old man eventually the topic got around to obamaand his role as our president the old rancher said 'well ya know obama is a 'post turtle'' not being familiar with the term the doctor asked him what a 'postturtle' was the old rancher said 'when you're driving down a country road and youcome across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top that's a 'postturtle' the old rancher saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continuedto explain you know he didn't get up there by himself he doesn't belong up there he doesn't know what to do while he's up there he's elevated beyond hisability to function and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him upthere to begin with
710643450,he's a perfect example of figures lie and liars figure
710643450,obviously he's telling them what they want to hear they like it contribute and then look forward to the change they've been looking for
710643450,more bad economic news and what does obama do leave town for six fundraisers has there ever been a president more out of touch with the people than this one does he have any idea how bad this makes him look you cannot make this stuff up
710643450,hey it is recovery summer ii brought to you by the great and powerful obama
710643450,obama is giving new meaning to country first
710643450,check out the labor secretary's comments on the jobs report on cnbc pathetic and truly frightening anchor's question what was your initial response when you heard the number her response silence she does not have a clue
710643450,for almost a year the bureau of labor statistics bls has over estimated job creation numbers having to revise them downward after they are published now we see two prior months revised in addition to an increase in this month's unemployment rate guess you can only hide bad news so long what is most disturbing is the downward revision of gdp growth from to in the first quarter this president has simply failed in helping the economy recover from the recession by his high taxes wasteful spending and over regulation
710643450,actually it is the weakest recovery in history but everyone else knows that so i am not going to do the research for ignorant person
710643450,the prior jobs reports from march and april were revised down by those are large adjustments which lead many to belive they overcount when announcing the number for the month and then revise downward a month later this pattern has been continued for over a year it used to be that a revision down happenned as often a revision upward making the idea of manipulation not out of question considering this administrations habit of being the most transparent administration in our lifetimes
710643450,million fewer american have jobs today than in until the country gets those jobs back the country will continue to stagnate
710643450,well half of that hope and change was right we got change why did so many assume that the changes would be good anyone who listened to obama knew what was coming sometimes it's tough to have to say we told you so do you think the obamabots will finally hear us probably not
710643450,seriously the schadenfreude is almost palpable but i digress i mean when you hire a community organizer with no experience in economics this is what you get it would be enjoyable to watch if i wasn't in the same sinking ship
710643450,you have to wonder how so few jobs were created yet the percentage of workers in the labor force increased by half a percent how
710643450,i cannot wait to hear the spin on this also notice when bush was in office he would report numbers and than revise them to the better obama is in offic and he is also over reporting and revising the numbers later to the worst either dims cannot do math or there are politics in what obama regime does to benefit him more evidence obama has no idea how to grow the economy and actually starting to show he wants more and more of america hurting to have to lean on the government for their basic needs you need dumb and lazy people or there will be no democratic party to speak of
710643450,have we ever had a summer recovery much less one that could actually go bad
710643450,more welfare more food stamps more illegal aliens etc etc etc hope and change is really working out great
710643450,it will be check the wapo online about a week from now you'll have to search for it at the bottom of the page but it's there and is always worse than originally reported
710643450,right along with the downward adjustment of gdp for q from to this jobs report is incredibly bleak and his response is the problem goes back to the bush years yes toto we're not in kansas anymore and it is bush's fault the markets are responding we were down and its now leveling the real unemployment numbers have been staving off talk of recession but we all know its bleak economists are looking at more mfg slowdown and full on recession w i months just in time for christmas this is no longer a merely key economic indicator it is now the beginning of obama's death spiral
710643450,of course the gracious george and laura bush were at the white house yesterday blame bush
710643450,hah great note thanks
710643450,yes even the man on the street can understand this
710643450,here is a cute lil diddy i saw earlier from another site and it's hilarious had to share here is what gw bush should do but i know he's too graceful of a man to do it but just the same it's hilarious the best thing that could happen is if gw just hauled off and punched obama right square in his lying mouth and when he was done have ole gw look down on him and say yep now that's my fault
710643450,that is great
710643450,here's a real indicator gold is up nearly point in less than one hr of market open
710643450,don't forget his flyover of wisconsin when he will wave at all his union friends down below
710643450,you could just get rid of cable altogether
710643450,harry reid and barack obama killed the initiatives from the house ask them
710643450,wait a minute according this administration the u s is in recovery
710643450,this report is damning evidence of the republicans' betrayal of the american people president obama has done everything he can to develop polices to create jobs and save america from the economic devastation the republicans created despite the obvious need for change the republicans continue to insist on the same failed policies which destroyed our economy and have obstructed almost everything the president has done or tried to do to achieve the change need this a shameful chapter in the history of the republican party
710643450,love it will now share it
710643450,are you enthusiastically doing drugs like your fearless leader
710643450,with this report my pick for romney's v p micheal steele he has a rep for winning he is the anti obama please not an empty suit like rubio a trojan horse like jeb bush m steele class smarts popular with the base
710643450,joe what is the reason that obama didnt pass jobs measures while he had complete control of government
710643450,you forgot expert on jews at least that's what he told a jewish group he was speaking to
710643450,unemployment is up romney is in as i have been saying business is waiting out this socialist administration when romney is elected the economy will boom baby you know it i know it
710643450,i didn't know harry reid was a republican
710643450,obama f uck you pos go mitt
710643450,the la raza dems have sabotaged e verify to help ease more illegals into our jobs in mex occupied ca the la raza illegals controlled state legislature passed a law making it illegal for employers to use e verify obama has sued az to stop e verify here s why we could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers said representative lamar smith of texas co chairman of the reclaim american jobs caucus president obama is on the wrong side of the american people on immigration the president should support policies that help citizens and legal immigrants find the jobs they need and deserve rather than fail to enforce immigration laws the principal beneficiaries of our current immigration policy are affluent americans who hire immigrants at substandard wages for low end work harvard economist george borjas estimates that american workers lose billion annually in depressed wages caused by the constant flooding of the labor market at the low wage end christian science monitor
710643450,exactly mate don't spoon feed the soros monkeys
710643450,i m one of your middle class americans and quite frankly i m exhausted exhausted of defending you defending your administration defending the mantle of change that i voted for a woman told president obama at a town hall i await the day the media gets out of obama's bed and does the same
710643450,the markets are indicators of themselves wall street has become political jobs report released and markets free fall obama responds and gold surges liberals are looking for bernacke to begin printing i agree look for boom and bull markets wednesday november after romney's landslide election
710643450,republican dirty trick is working gop game plan tank the economy refuse to cooperate with obama to fix it and then blame obama for the economy they think americans are stupid to notice their dirty trick
710643450,so now obama minions are out in full force making sure everyone realizes the problems has been long in the making aka bushes fault and is attacking republicans by pushing congress to tackle obama's to do list
710643450,the state department issues visas each month another young people become of age to get a full time job each month another illegals make it across the border each month we need new jobs a month just to break even half of those people are illegals the only real solution to unemployment is to enforce the immigration laws
710643450,keep smoking that dope joe and collect that welfare check
710643450,you'd expect that old shriveled up deceitful socialist leaning democrat harry reid to call for 'working together' when his boss' family jewels are on the line when it's inevitable that republicans have the upper hand in government the democrats and mainstream media push for middle of the road republicans who can compromise make deals with the other side of the aisle and pretty much not cause any waves i e rino traitors conversely when the democrats have the upper hand do you see any evidence of 'compromise' or conciliatory behavior comrade maobama said it best after the general election losing elections has consequences it's a typical marxist ploy when you have the upper hand deny your enemy everything when your enemy has the upper hand negotiate compromise and promise the moon to him but do not deliver fight socialism no compromise no surrender
710643450,so much for all that recovery bs obama and the democrats have been spewing i would be afraid to see what the real unemployment rate is i read a while back there are million people that are no longer looking for work and are no longer counted in the unemployment rate when will these idiots understand you cannot fix a debt problem with more debt if you could there would never be any bankruptcies these idiots better start cutting the spending and the bailouts and the stimulus money now we are well on our way to being a third world country if they dont start using common sense
710643450,you re an idiot
710643450,i am a maryland resident steele is not popular with the base after his failed tenure as rnc chair and he will not be able to carry his home state and mine romney will most likely pick a swing state governor like portman or mcdonnel

710643450,the jobless claims numbers have been systematically under reported and have been revised upward for of the past weeks showing a clear pattern of deception on the part of the obama bls
710643450,romney will be a big hit with anyone who was ever unemployed on cbs news last night he said his solution to putting americans back to work is to allow them to create unemployment savings accounts where they could deposit money and possibly his word have some federal matching funds these accounts could be drawn upon when the individual is unemployed and it would provide an incentive to return to work they'll run out much sooner than unemployment insurance will so now the financing of unemployment will shift from the employer who pays towards unemployment insurance to the employee who will plan and pay for her his unemployment the minute s he enters the workforce then again he likes to fire people so this gets him and his fellow businessmen off the financial hook and spares the congressional republicans the need to take a stand on extending unemployment benefits look for the usa unemployment savings accounts has a nice patriotic ring to it bill and talk about the unemployed as if they all like sitting back and collecting checks but that's after the election just remember u s a u s a

710643450,april had jobs added and here we are being told how bad april's score really was that month dropped to unemployment shouldn't the bls make april's score and may of course that is too logical under president bush we were told jobs had to be added each month just for the rate to stay the same from one month to the next under obama this was not true you can see the bls is politically motivated by the way under president bush for years the average unemployment was
710643450,and you think this because gee i'd really like to have the bush unemployment rate the market back at housing prices going up and gas prices at less than two bucks instead of four bucks yeah those bush years were sure tough
710643450,fyi only about of jobs in the us are union jobs what about the other the veterans won't find work there either these pathetic numbers illustrate that obama has done nothing to grow any job be it union private sector public sector etc his epa is killing industry manufacturing oil coal gas etc with regulations that raise costs and stifle growth my grandfathers were both cleveland blue collar union workers so please don't reply back that i'm a union hater
710643450,no the obama lovers are screwing this country over
710643450,president obama has done everything he can do develop policies to create jobs lol rofl you mean the same obama who cancelled any new oil drilling in the gulf of mexico and killed the keystone pipeline the same president whose policies are killing off private sector health insurance and now targeting faith based health care services meanwhile obama is soooo concerned about these job numbers do you know what he's doing about it he's going to six yes six fundraisers this weekend obama and his party had complete control of washington for two years and made a huge mess in the process you can't blame bush or the gop for that
710643450,again you continue to prove you're probably one of those paid bots who spreads this easily debunked propaganda there has been zero jobs created under obama we have lost about million bls numbers compare number of employed americans in jan of to june of and a record amount have given up and dropped out of the labor force did you not read this line in the article above after falling to a year low of percent the nation's labor participation rate picked up slightly to percent offsetting the april decline do you know what that means you brainless dolt that means more unemployed under obama than under bush clinton bush i there has been zero net jobs created also if we were losing per month and unemployment was how many jobs were lost when unemployment remains above for years critical thinking skills isn't your strong suite
710643450,except reality and numbers prove you're stupid
710643450,public sector unions steal every penny they can from the taxpayers it is just another form of welfare and needs to be outlawed a union president told me once that he spends of his time protecting of the workforce the laziest bums who deserve to be fired what a waste

710643450,ten years of tax cuts for the repub job creators and this is all ther better they can do what crap it is time for all of them to pay their fair share of taxes and let the government create a million infrastructure jobs the bush job creators had their chance
710643450,spot on there old atlantic and rino willard mittens romney is bush iii as well just say no to bush iii willard mittens romney in the job you save maybe your own since romney likes to fire people and ship our own american jobs overseas to india communist china and mexico and sit going up and down in his inside the house car elevator counting his ill gotten million dollar fortune that mitt romney keeps hidden in his numberous cayman islands bermuda and swiss bank accounts
710643450,the employment will only get worse under obama lets not forget the job created overseas by president obama offering to help brazil expand offshore drilling while u s production struggles to get back on its feet in the wake of the bp spill the president on the first leg of his trip to latin america said in brazil that his administration wants to assist the brazilian government with technology and support in developing its oil reserves a black gold mine he said could hold twice as much oil as u s deposits and when you're ready to start selling we want to be one of your best customers obama said with u s oil exploration and drilling slowing to a crawl over the past year they questioned why the president would throw u s weight behind brazil a country that also received a billion loan for its state owned oil company from the u s export import bank
710643450,the whole government is a failure dems reps all that being said it is a global economy and when europe asia south america are all slowing and collapsing not much can be done without huge stimulus but that is not happening
710643450,nope they are george h w bush and george w bush and bush wannabee willard mittens romney as the third bush loser
710643450,these numbers got out due the the fact that the actual numbers are far worse this game of cooked numbers goes way back idiot america
710643450,in less than four years obama has over spent by trillion we still have over unemployment we still have anemic gdp growth we are still printing money that is propping up the stock market we still have housing at depression levels we are still funding long term unemployment welfare food stamps are still increasing doubled since obama took office we still have those in poverty numbers steadily increasing since obama took office gold prices are still increasing since obama took office and that is not a good sign the dollar is still decreasing in value and will not get better until the federal reserve stops printing and raises interest rates we are still losing 's of millions of tax payer dollars on failed green energy businesses the only real good news is oil prices is going down a little due to increased production on private land and state controlled land and also because opec has recently increased oil production the worse news we are headed toward another recession in to months obama was supposed to be the most intelligent president we have ever had but that is what they say we have yet been able to see his transcripts from occidental columbia and harvard for all we know he was a dunce in his book dreams of my father he did say he drank and did drugs during his college years i doubt he had better than a c average what suprises me is the lengths obama has gone to seal his college records when every president before him made them public if america was to learn a lesson from the past few years it is this never hire such an inexperienced person to be president we had the best choice availabe in hillary clinton mccain would have been just as bad as obama but palin would have been light years ahead of the other dunce in chief biden the is country would have been far better off with hilary clinton as president instead of the disaster we have now we hired a guy who was a state senator part time a u s senator part time a community activist and organizer and a less than stellar constitutional law professor and a man who counts running the school newspaper the harvard law review as his only executive experience and according to his publicist and literary agent and in his own words from his own book he doesn't know where he was born a guy with zero business experience zero and he hires his administration who also have very little if any business experience they are academics when we needed business people we are going into another recession because obama never had a clue about the economy our gdp has hovered at or less most of his presidency and unemployment reported by the government is with just jobs in may and over million new jobless claims our actual unemployment number is over according to the u s debt clock and the biggest laugh of all obama and biden claim their policies are working my question to that is which one name one policy that is working
710643450,most americans just want a job not a hand out from the government they want to be independent and control their own destinies that why a socialist system in this country will never work people want less government interference in their lives not more the big check always comes with strings
710643450,are you better off today than you were years ago
710643450,community organizers do not make good business people or presidents maybe obama can get his old community organizer job back in chicago after his first and only term chicago seems to be having a huge crime wave and gang related violence maybe he wasn't so good at that job either he seems to leave a mess wherever he's been
710643450,thirty five big u s based multinational companies added jobs much faster than other u s employers in the past two years but nearly three fourths of those jobs were overseas according to a wall street journal analysis those companies which include wal mart stores inc international paper co honeywell international inc and united parcel service inc boosted their employment at home by or jobs between and the same rate of increase as the nation's other employers but they also added more than jobs in their far flung and faster growing foreign operations the companies included in the analysis were the largest of those

710643450,fewer job created than expected only don't make yourself dizzy with all you spinning if obama would have moved more to the center like clinton did we would probably be seeing the beginning of a true recovery now not the signs of a impending double dip nobody is rooting for americans to fail it just hard for many republicans to watch the liberals dump this great country into a deeper and deeper hole
710643450,try over regulations obamacare lack of consumer spending due to high unemoyment all caused by obama you're posts are nothing more than your opinion

710643450,then what was the point of all of the jobs supposedly saved or created by the trillion dollar stimulus those workers have been laid off anyway and now we have an additional trillion in debt for a quick history lesson from about government spending secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau admitted that his new deal was a failure we have tried spending money we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work i want to see this country prosperous i want to see people get a job i want to see people get enough to eat we have never made good on our promises i say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work it was may and morgenthau was appearing before powerful democrats on the house ways and means committee
710643450,the acknowledgment of the march and april numbers is not a revision it was the correction of a lie
710643450,one question why do we continue to issue work visas to foreigners when we have million unemployed when the economy began to tank in all work visas should've been stopped immediately and not resumed until our national employment rate falls under instead democrats keep writing bills to allow more visas and to give green cards to educated foreigners to come work here is it any wonder our country is failing

710643450,communist propoganda
710643450,the trillion dollar shovel ready stimulus already failed so did the new deal as admitted by both fdr and morgenthau socialism simply does not work nor does keynesianism which is precisely why the president's policies have done nothing to help the economy secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau admitted that his new deal was a failure we have tried spending money we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work i want to see this country prosperous i want to see people get a job i want to see people get enough to eat we have never made good on our promises i say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work it was may and morgenthau was appearing before powerful democrats on the house ways and means committee

710643450,as nobel prize winning economist paul krugman explained today when the private sector is frantically trying to pay down debt the public sector should do the opposite spending when the private sector can t or won t by all means let s balance our budget once the economy has recovered but not now the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity instead congress driven by a cut happy republican house has pursued austerity leading to hundreds of thousands of public sector job losses last month alone state and local level education jobs disappeared something you tea bagger anti government nuts will never agree

710643450,when confronted with the irrefutable evidence of your economic failures you waste time and energy attempting to deflect obama has greatly expanded the h b visa program where is your selective outrage on that fact
710643450,looks like your man is going down in flames to a hard crash landing wait till obamacare gets thrown out should be a great month
710643450,spam all you like deflection is an ineffective tactic and you are simply a soros troll as evidenced by the fact that multiple people including some who are foreign post under your screen name be aware however that the more you do this the more data i will post which will show obama losing mort zuckerman president obama's economic programs have failed by mortimer b zuckerman april the problem now is not that people are being laid off by the millions when an economy has reached bottom as it did it has already shed much of its labor and layoffs slow but the anemic recovery has not yielded job vacancies hiring today is at about percent of the level given the increase in unemployed totals job seekers are only about one third as likely to find work as in compare that to the fabled great depression of the s in the three years after the economy rebounded with growth rates of percent percent and percent but in months into our recovery growth was about percent followed by percent growth in the rate for could be about percent below the percent throughout the postwar period
710643450,think how bad this would be if obummer released the true figures remember they dropped the inflation rate from almost just by removing food and energy costs
710643450,the last two times we did that it caused depressions idiot
710643450,they see it as an opportunity to cut entitlements to hell with jobs or economy they are dead locked with finally getting rid of fdr social policies and regain power in the white house if we hang tough til november we can ward of another wall street deregulating robber baron administration
710643450,the real unemployment rate is between and that is relying on inaccurate bls numbers even more dire stats than those massaged by the bls with detailed explanations can be found on the website www shadowstats com
710643450,so reid is admitting that everything he has done in office is wrong
710643450,i'm disappointed cuts to domestic spending have only resulted in an percent unemployment rate if we cut domestic spending by another trillion we can easily beat the euro zones percent and spain's percent unemployment rates lets go repubs
710643450,what you will remember is that the president you elected is singularly unqualified to fix the economy a fact that is backed up by the firing of romer summers goolsbee orszag rattner feinberg daley barnes and the entire economic council with the exception of tim geithner the president cancelled his morning economic briefings months ago perhaps he should not have done that
710643450,click on this you spammer
710643450,she is smarter than you
710643450,that is true and it annoyed the hell out of me but the good news is oil is plummeting and gas will follow in three weeks they excluded it because it is not really inflation high food prices are the result of the increased costs of transporting with high gas prices
710643450,the private sector can't and won't because the o'failure is spending wasting the private sector's money on his big fat cat union and green buddies
710643450,hey tiger since i am now a minority how do i get the freebies you get
710643450,the government under obama has balloned out of control when you have agencies doing the same thing one agency could do you should cut of them cutting government jobs is the best thing this administration could do why because everyone of those jobs requires taxpayer funding from the benefits they receive the salary the get the taxes they pay all has to be paid for by a tax paying private sector work the larger government gets the poverty worsens why because in order to fund the increased size of government they have to transfer money from the private sector to the public sector and the more money they take out less jobs are available because business has to compensate for the additional government burden employees are expensive to a busines and when the government takes money out of your company the only thing you can do is lay people off and laying a person off now makes them a government dependent on unemployment compensation for weeks paid for by the business to government funded unemployment welfare for weeks if available to welfare and food stamps unless you go the other route and fake your way onto the ssdi roles which accelerates the depletion of social security funds jobs would not be a problem if obama would have made the tax cuts permanent cut spending cut regulation and not burdened the private sector with obamacare as for obamacare there was no need to do it the way they did there were a lot of great ideas that were disregarded because pelosi reid and obama wanted single payer government controlled health care and tell me this really would you want your health care in the hads of the government that has failed at everything they do everything government does is mismanaged and over spent they never cut anything and when it expands they come after the private sector for more money reagan had it right and he is the only president to ever say it the government is not the solution the government is the problem and if there was ever an example obama's administration is it
710643450,so how much did you pay in taxes this year tiger
710643450,paul krugman is so up obamams behind that he can see his tonsils an dhe has been wrong so often he is a laughing stock you might as well have quoted hugo chavez you really are a total left wing robot pathetic

710643450,mr cantor what have you and boehner done lately or ever to help america recover from bush recession zero you are gleeful that your game plan is working remember your famous meeting with ryan gingrich and others on the day of obama's inauguration to obstruct every obama administration initiative to fix the bush economy ever since you have been doing just that tank the economy refuse to cooperate with obama and then blame obama you are not coming to this debate about the economy with a clean hand buddy you surely think americans are stupid and wouldn't notice and would reward republicans nonetheless that wouldn't happen in november you can bet on it
710643450,mitt romney is a candidate for the presidency the president his staff and even democrat party notables have let it be known that mitt romney is the candidate they don t want running against obama this match will center the media as well as the public on obamas dismal record in office that record centers around the presidents lack of business experience and continues nationally a high rate of joblessness elitist socialistic management exorbitant hollywood parties quiet obedience to wall street bankers travel excesses frequent vacation substitutions for work and an overall disregard for entrepreneurship obama wants to avoid mitt romney a great businessman at all costs mitt romney is thoroughly equipped with a great management background he has been successful in business for the most part for years at this moment a man of financial success is needed during a time that boasts an overall growth in lack of trust in government romney s work with our winter olympics is financial legend in contrast to the president s failure to attract a future olympiad to chicago the family of mitt romney is solid and shares it s role models with americans mitt s wife ann promotes harmony character and teamwork as a christian i note a personal faith commitment is a positive in leading our country although mitt s a faith perspective may be different than mine one s faith should not have any negative bearing on running for the presidency john kennedy faced this challenge as a catholic seeking the same office in reverend herbert meza a presbyterian chaired nominee kennedy s appearance before some ministers and a similar number of observers his speech was honestly presented and dealt with this question comprehensively for all present to hear his response in as relevant today as it was in the past i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be a catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him that is the kind of america in which i believe and it represents the kind of presidency in which i believe a great office that must be neither humbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnished by arbitrary withholding its occupancy from members of any religious group i believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private affairs neither imposed upon him by the nation or imposed upon him as a condition to holding that office if my church attempted to influence me in any way which was improper or which affected adversely my responsibilities as a public servant sworn to uphold the constitution then i would reply to them that this was an improper action on their part that it was one to which i could not subscribe that i was opposed to it and that it would be an unfortunate breech an interference with the american political system i am confident there will be no such interference kennedy further stated if he found any conflict between his conscience and the responsibility of the presidency he would resign the office john f kennedy was running for president as an american i am personally honored by the prospect of mitt romney s candidacy and with millions of others i look forward to his leadership barack obama fears it alan phillips

710643450,all of your rant is straight from the talking points tabloid and little of it is cogent or lucid did you forget that the democrats controlled both houses from january thru january and the democrats have controlled the senate and the executive branch for over three of those same years for you to even attempt to link or blame a political party for all of the things you ranted about is sort of silly and made even funnier by your obvious failure to recall just exactly who held the purse strings for that entire year period it was the democratically controlled house and senate now to be sure republicans have had some genuine problems during that same year period keeping or maintaining what is typically called a more conservative viewpoint and more restrained tax and fiscal policy but at no time in through were the republicans in charge of any of the purse strings nor did they chair any committee at any point during that same year time frame your thesis sentence above is just plain factually inaccurate you can't start keeping score whenever you want simply to associate everything with your own version of history you are not implying that the entire mess this country is in started exactly when the republicans re gained control of the house in are you or was it started just for the years george bush was president but none of the and half years that obama has been president with a full congressional cycle with the democrats then controlling all three the executive branch the house and the senate pleeeeez
710643450,because it is a jobless recovery there are no jobs million jobs went overseas the only industry hiring is the green industry plus million but it is an industry created from start ups
710643450,this report is a sharp reminder that democrats and republicans should be working together to strengthen our economy create jobs and put the middle class ahead of partisan politics reid said if this is true then why hasn't harry brought the gop jobs bills that are collecting dust on his desk to a vote he's talking the politics of convenience romney shouldn't have much trouble sparring with a party who has one arm tied behind their backs by radical ideology that laser beam focus has proven to be all talk did they focus on jobs during the yars when they had total control of our congress and the wh no
710643450,drink your obama kool aid and take a nap obamas plane will be by soon to pick up all his fleas
710643450,drink your obama kool aid and take a nap obamas plane will be by soon to pick up all his fleas
710643450,jobs are the only metric that matters what malarkey everyone knows that president obama does not control the monthly jobs unemployment report why do the news media and the cable tv talking heads continue to spend so much time pretending that he does and another thing where are the job creators taxes are still the lowest in decades no new regulations are being imposed when are the job creators going to get busy more comments on my blog barley literate by rick
710643450,jobs bills passed by the house sit in harry reid's inbox

710643450,glenn beck was correct from the get go and george wallace was damn correct
710643450,instead democrats keep writing bills to allow more visas and to give green cards to educated foreigners to come work here you think the us education system might be a factor here when classes don't get 'pass' grades they 'lower the scale' i thought the idea was to actually learn something jeff
710643450,nice if obummer would do something to help not hinder recovery that would truly be a miracle
710643450,much worse than reported
710643450,russell you are becoming unglued and this most recent post borders on being almost pitiful i'm sorry dude but you just can't opine like that and not expect some push back in fact you just inadvertently confirmed the wisdom of ronald reagan since apparently he knew in the 's that solar panels just did not have what it takes to meet a country's energy needs and here we are some years later and solar panels still don't have what it takes to operate a country of this size and to think that many people thought reagan was dumb
710643450,you are so sad how does a grown person get suckered into believing these things i know the whole world is fooled except for you
710643450,even impeached willly agrees that you are nuts

710643450,like what make bush tax cuts permanent trickle down we did that for the last decade and it did nothing to creste job growth all it did was make the deficit grow and make the rich richer
710643450,yeah that was when this country suddenly found itself taking two wage earners per household just to keep a families head above water do you realize that the prime lending rate during the carter malaise reached or percent do you have any idea of what would happen to this country if prime interest rates even go to half of that carter percent mess the country would be insolvent overnight trying to compare the jimmy carter fiscal mess with what ronald reagan accomplished can only be described as sheer lunacy
710643450,your choom gangsta savior got everything he wanted what bills did he want that didn't pass hmm your failed stimulus didn't work how hard is this you think more stimulus would work doing the same thing and expecting different results is a sign of insanity
710643450,simple when the numbers are good obama pats himself on the back when they are bad blame bush the house whomever that is exactly what a leader does obama is worthless simple fact we have tried socialism and government creates the economy and his belief has failed again what do they call someone that keeps doing the same things over and over and expecting a different result a dimocrat
710643450,yeah and they consist of tax cuts for the rich and big oil little concentrated don't you think
710643450,tax cuts and less regulation saved us from the peanut farmer ditto when obummer joins the peanut farmer in
710643450,obama is the least qualified person in any room no experience no qualifications to be president throw in black marxism and chicago thuggery and this is armeggedon time in america
710643450,don't you guys call them undocumented workers these days how come under reagan they are illegal aliens but under obama they are undocumented workers more obvious guile and craft and the majority of the folks in this country millions of democrats and republicans are simply not picking up what you guys are trying to lay down any more the days of total bullsh t are over
710643450,i'll wait for the real news to report on it until then
710643450,insane useful idiot

710643450,road to recovery from the gop stock market now doubled and the job loss handed obama for one month january
710643450,so you don t like the idea of people keeping what they ve earned you d rather see the country continue it s downgrade under the democrat s socialist national agenda
710643450,will the left finally admit that their socialist national agenda is a failure just as the same agenda is failing over in europe and has failed each and every time it s been tried trying to spread the wealth around and controlling the economy through a regulatory regime on discourages growth as we ve seen over the past few years of the downgrade regime why do we have to keep on repeating the same insanity over and over again
710643450,it created a booming economy and record low unemployment but don't let the facts get in the way of your bleating sheep
710643450,the do nothing congress are you referring to the dim o crit super majority or the dim o crit controlled senate that refuses to allow bipartisan jobs bills to even come to a vote
710643450,this is reality this is it we have to add jobs a month for the next three year or years to get out of this republicans won they will make corporations tax free and put the burden of funding the government on middle and lower classes the middle class will disappear and no one will be left to pay for goods and services corporations will continue to manufacture overseas no cars or houses will be sold infrastructure will crumble an america coup has occurred by the it is over

710643450,don't be so hard on him he probably has never owned a business since he hates capitalism so he doesn't understand how the private sector works as all fringe cult progressives think that obama will some how get us out of this fiscal disaster i am sorry to say that obama's ideology won't let that happen
710643450,observably you do not
710643450,except fannie mae and ginnie mac don't write mortgages they only buy them from banks and wall street so it frees up banks reserves to write more mortgages worked for years when banks wrote mortgages responsibly then enter wall street trying to compete with the gses they acted like the gses by buying mortgages from non financial ie brokers under the radar of banking regulation then thyroid gses tried to compete and loosened underwriting standards to include non traditional mortgages like wall street
710643450,how did we compete before there are some jobs that can t be shipped over seas what about them
710643450,selective memory indeed the crash did not occur until a half year after the dim o crits took over congress sorry if the facts contradict your propaganda maybe that should tell you something
710643450,reply to independent will the left finally admit that their socialist national agenda is a failure how did we compete before there are some jobs that can t be shipped over seas what about them
710643450,no i am good it wasn't about me it was about country
710643450,i meant to say to pay for a portion of their health care
710643450,stupid and naive to believe in the idea of america when it is all corrupted and run by greed
710643450,the failure here is the bush policies that caused the mess that romney wants to go back to the failure here more specifically is the bush policies of catering to the wealthy that enrich the very top but wreck havoc on the financial system that defined romney's business career and again are completely responsible for the mess we are in the failure here is the gop does not see that its' constant terrorist like obstructionism has real consequences and they do not see the impact their devotion to imposing their regressive agenda is having on the american people
710643450,oil will kill green other than that i don't have a replacement industry there goes million jobs when that happens and the country resebles a fascist state not communist state
710643450,just read the posts over the past several days he proverbial gig is up it is all anout the economy and america isn't stupid obama's administration is a failure everyone knows it obama needs to step back and realize history will not treat him with praise the first black president has let down his people along with all those colorblind folks who felt america had finally turned the corner this is a sad commentary on mlk's legacies no entitlement increases yet more of his folks are mired in poverty and jobless his strong support of women is bolstered now with female gender based abortions and he's brought influence peddling to a historic low his presidency is in death throws in the short intervening months let's hope he doesn't commit political suicide and play his agenda through executive orders
710643450,i disagree has nothing to do with race big money was too powerful and too many politians are corrupt and bought he failed because republicans believe in trickle down economics they believe this even as the middle class is disappearing this was a fight for the survival of the middle class
710643450,oh now they want twork with the gop i uiught thy had to sit in the back obama said that back in they can ride along but they will have to ride in the back so that only tells us that obama and the liberals have been driving this rig down a bumpy road going nowhere but a cliff awaits at the end how can you blame others for wrecking when he is driving he can't although he will try this baby is all his so he needs to rock it but the sad fact of the matter he is invaluable of doing anything incompetence breeds more incompetence let's just put band aid on this matter till someone with the capabilities like mitt can come in and fix obamas mess it's obvious that obama can't get it done
710643450,how gracious of you just like in england
710643450,crash happened in september obama was sworn in january sorry you missed it
710643450,the only thing harry reid cares about is his own job and the contingent of socialist stooges he hired for his crony capitalist network the one thing that can get america back to work is pass a law that would make it a crime of treason for anyone in government that promotes marxist ideals while in government vote these zuckers out in november and throw out of the last generations socialist laws
710643450,narcissistic much btw good luck with your business hope it doesn't depend on customers lol

710643450,what is this we will let you crap and dummy this country has never been a democracy again what is this we crap you would starve to death or freeze to death folks like you are the first to go you really want to relinquish the power of the state remember they are the ones who will put you in jail for not paying your taxes and everybody knows that your kind do not have the spine to stand up and but their asses in harms way your kind has no discipline to do anything but whine
710643450,independent lazy sponge on welfare
710643450,i really don't understand your reply what i said wasn't a joke it is true we need to realize this it isn't about blaming people but it is about making sure we don't go back to the same policies romney was endorsed by bush he was endorsed by bush's father and he was endorsed by bush's brother and by the way i also included the gop's terrorist like obstructionism here is what i don't get there is nothing wrong with pointing out the truth to avoid problems in the future or even for purposes of discussion world war ii was hitler's fault right that is still true today and it has been almost year's since it ended and no i'm not comparing bush to hitler although bush certainly did a tremendous amount of damage and will go down as one of the worst presidents in american history i'm just pointing out common sense logic you are ignoring another thing over of americans actually blame bush more than they blame obama
710643450,you guys could never really grasp that it was private insurance could you got in all of a panic thinking it was a government takeover it is a little distressful that policy is shaped by people who get their news from breitbart the conspirator lol
710643450,moron on a conspiracy website and i am financially able to pick and leave the country if you loons happen to win my finances are just fine thank you
710643450,you are factually ignorant there is no such thing as medicaid part d it is medicare part d if you do not know the difference you are from this moment on you are in the corner with a dunce hat medicaid is a system which provides medical services for the poor and has had no change since they had pharmacy benefits for a long time medicare is not that it is for folks and over or disability part d provides for a premium paid pharmacy benefit do you know what the word pharmacy means what i was referencing was the temporary lowering of fica taxes do you know what that is you may call it social security taxes if it helps you to understand the more people pay into the ss system the more they get at retirement they are paying less so now old people will get less because of that and there is no method to offset the loss are you proud that your pres is causing people in there older years to have less money do you want to part d to be gone so old people will not be able to have medication i would say shame on you but i am not certain that you can understand any of this learn before you speak to do otherwise shows you to be the fool
710643450,and what would you expect when you have an administration in power that continually tightens the noose around the neck of american business and our economy come nov evict the idiot in our wh and start america on the road to recovery
710643450,just what is this noose of regulation around your neck tell me
710643450,as opposed to city or suburbs
710643450,you do not understand the difference between the pure ideal and the flawed but good reality learn that if this place is so bad why are people lining up en mass to become citizens you have no clue and you are to be more pitied than scorned you seem to be a very very sad man
710643450,yes and they lower orders are still the lower orders your people noblesse noblige
710643450,just temporarily down if you really appreciated capitalism you would know that competion is not alive and well it depends to much on government and consolidation competition and co sumer choice is the real capitalism what we have is predatory capitalism and a trapped consumer
710643450,that is an unfair and regressive system have you not thought about a different system
710643450,yeah idmlike to hear that too taxes lower than in yrs regulations wht regulations are you a hedge fund mnager or somethin
710643450,you do not understand what capitalism is risk and reward and for a change you have made a modicum of sense what we have now whilst not perfect has done more for more people than any other system show me one better and one which has people from all other the world to get into it be specific not flatulent
710643450,another example that the democrat's policy has not worked every christmas and holiday season you get better numbers and the democrats proclaim the supremacy of their policy every year those numbers fall apart and are revised down and the rest of the year stays stagnant you would think they learn something even lab animals learn faster than this in behavioral tests
710643450,what regulations try starting a business nearly impossible with all those mentally challenged government bureaucrats interfering every way they can into our business
710643450,all he was trying to do was to save capitalism and the middle class what we had was predatory capitalism not held to account real capitalism requires competition and consumer choice all the business models want a taxpayer guarantee no risk and no worry about loss if profit if failed that is fascism not capitalism bunch of moaning cause of consumer protections cry about rules and that is predatory capitalism
710643450,government controlled health care really worked out great for the people in nazi germany soviet union castro's cuba communist china and all the other murdering dictatorships in history yep a really great idea
710643450,no not much at all if you cannot understand the post it is not my problem i have been in a business for years with a lot of clients though the years and now i am doing business with their children and grand children and guess what it is legal
710643450,do you comprehend what you read it is private insurance
710643450,ah seems like you have shown a distinct lack of knowledge yet again first t you need to find out what medicaid is and when it provided pharmacy benefits and then find out what medicare is and what is the relationship to each i will give you a guess one had nothing to do with part d and one does
710643450,like what
710643450,no room lol
710643450,whats the old saying better to keep you mouth shut and let them think youre a complete idiot rather than open your mouth an remove all doubt
710643450,i imagined nothing less and by the way it is not about you it is the system so please quit defending yourself to me
710643450,no but tell me about yours
710643450,your whining i will just leave lol
710643450,private insurance obozo's death panels private insurance

710643450,fact this is the second time i have seen this phony maddow blog chart it is a joke right
710643450,fact growth to carter was how many cars can get in a odd even gas line carter and obama epic boobs
710643450,j if paul krugman means that stimulus should come out in no larger increments than billion at a time then he is right if you do this in the background to cover weak growth over time you will assist the employees the avenue of seeing the economy slowly increase over time yet if the idea is simply to buoy an under employed economy until the entire corporate world in terms of re employing americans to blue collar jobs primarily happens then the idea is failed before it starts why because the idea of waiting on growth like instant oatmeal will never happen it is the economy stupid so you need a side issue of government in small amounts to off set the meagre growth until the value of these small inputs are reduced by the financial gains of individuals over a longer term of both fiscal and psychological terms krugman's point seems only at the present to be shielded by the idea of 'pouring more money out after qe but in fact i believe he is talking incrementally herein which makes short term fiscal sense and long term economic sense on america's books
710643450,and then the uprising will begin
710643450,siya fringe cult progressive
710643450,enjoy your delusion while you can this is america we don't herd like sheep
710643450,how hypocritical of harry reid to call for bi partisan action on a jobs bill now harry reid and other dinosaurs like him from both parties are the reason no jobs bill has passed so far i again believe that if our government is to succeed we have to get rid of veteran dinosaurs from both parties while they get fat and rich feeding at the public trough and then get a lucrative retirement the common guy gal gets screwed no more dinosaurs

710643450,the numbers are from the bureau of labor statistics democrats don't lie here is the bureau chart they are identical
710647674,the obamas and the bushs unveiled the two portraits of laura and george w the other day to great jocularity and mutual generosity a small oasis of civility in the relentlessly cruel world of american politics
710663221,this should say warren regrets lying
710663221,right because no other politician on either side of the aisle has ever lied ever i would much rather have a politician who lied about something as insignificant as her heritage than any other politician lying about which economic policies will get us out of this mess supply side economics anybody do you agree with her message that the middle class needs protection and an equal voice in politics or are you just against her because she has a d in front of her name
710663221,many people in oklahoma have native american blood that can not prove it so if she said she is lying then she would be lying
710663221,ms warren please drop out of the race we have enough impersonators in washington thank you
710663221,and if liz warren had kept her dubious claims to cherokee heritage strictly to social and cultural settings then no one would care however when she started checking boxes as to being a minority in professional journals and informing her employers that she's native american for federal diversity reporting regulations then that's when this becomes a serious issue as to her character and reputation for honesty she had absolutley no right to claim minority status in any professional capactity also it's amazing how her alleged heritage was so important to her but she identified herself as white for the mediocre schools she actually attended it was only when she was looking to make the leap to the ivy leagues that she started claiming minority status she's the only nd tier law school grad on harvard law's faculty which strangely coincides with her being the the only native american on that faculty face it she lied about her ethnic heritage for professional gain and her lie has been discovered instead of taking responsibility and asking for forgiveness she continues to spout lies she's an arrogant dishonest narcissist and do we really need another one of those in washington
710663221,most of us are concerned with integrity you didn't care about the people you hurt when you gamed the system and now you care only about your campaign and your quest for personal power disgraceful
710663221,we are against anyone lacking in character or having problems with honesty we are against people who injure others via gaming the system and attempting to use affirmative action to advance their careers knowing it is fraudulent duke cunningham went to prison as did jack abramov and this woman is not fit to serve as a senator either
710663221,insignificant to lie about her heritage in the us it matters a lot especially claiming to be native american at harvard
710663221,maybe ms warren has a claim and maybe she doesn't regardless if the voters in massachusetts decide to vote for mr brown or her the outcome will be what they want not what those of us think should they should or shouldn't do wether a person lies or doesn't it's easy to say they did and then the conspiracy theory takes off
710663221,her maiden name was herring perhaps her loved ones term of endearment for the young ms warren was red
710663221,warren is an academic nincompoop
710663221,what's outrageous are the reports that lizzie's native american brothers and sisters are planning to protest at tomorrow's state convention in mass they fail to see how she has reached out to them spiritually if not politically i think there's a pattern of deception that is emerging and she's showing that she did know and that she did do these things said david cornsilk a year old citizen of cherokee nation who co created a group called cherokees demand truth from elizabeth warren david should be more supportive and work with lizzie to unite all native americans with her legal and financial expertise she could help secure large reparations for her people to many people are trying to hold her accountable to some genetic formula she's native american because she feels native american she is a self identified native american as for the charge of lying it was more revenge for the centuries of lies and broken treaties her people have suffered elect her and right the wrong our president needs her to help us go forward
710663221,she's an indian because she feeeeeeeeels like one you libs put an awful lot of stock in feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelings don't you what else can you conjure into reality because of your feeeeeeelings she's not cherokee she's a liar she did it to jump start her career and give her an edge over honest people tell you what lib do you feeeeeeel like a bird jump off a tall building and fly then let's put your feeeeeeeelings theory to the test
710663221,i feeeeeeeel like an indian too i've decided which tribe gets the most money from oil and gas development that's the one i feeeeeel like when can i expect my checks as for reparations they can blow it out their arses my ancestors weren't even in this country until the th century nor am i in any way responsible for the actions of my ancestors i'm responsible for me and me alone
710663221,huh she's reached out to them spiritually what are you talking about she told the boston herald that the only reason she listed herself as a minority in the legal directories in the s was to meet people with similar heritage never mind the directory doesn't specify what the minority is but the boston globe has reported that she never attended a single native american function at harvard ever also have you not been reading the stories where the cherokees say they have had their calls to meet with warren repeatedly ignored she is in very serious trouble and she has no native american blood i'm of scottish descent through and through by your argument i could just suddenly decide to say i am of african descent please educate yourself and actually read the news stories on this issue
710663221,she's handling it the way she is because she knows her story is bogus oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
710663221,um no please don't play that game and say it is just about her heritage this is about her claiming to be a native american to get a job then telling boston reporters she didn't know harvard was touting her as a native american for seven years it's about lie after lie after lie she also claimed to be the first ever nursing mother to take the new jersey bar exam despite the fact that women had been taking it years before her she's a sham and a scary narcissist
710663221,please wwe need to give her a chance lizzie speaks with the wisdom from living in both worlds to many of us write here with anger in our hearts but she campaigns with courage and understanding sometimes the right path is not the easiest one and her dreams have pointed her down thatr path she knows that while the can own the earth and yet all they own is earth if elected we will learn things we never knew she will paint us a new future painted with all the colours of the wind
710663221,warren is a parasite warren wants to hoard her own million warren does not want to give away her loot to charity but she sure knows how to tax the middle class
710663221,put the rye down and take a few steps back
710663221,this is so sad if we could only learn to listen with our hearts we could tell which voice we were really meant to hear
710663221,it not about whether she is white or copper skinned we need to learn to sing with all the voices of the mountain then we will move forward
710663221,yes many moons ago the turtle moved thus unleashing the frewater in the land of the white eyes rise up kindred souls from spirirt worlds of long ago and harken the return of the great white buffalo from whence the light became darkness in the realms of your own journey the sacred shaman weaves a path of enlightenment from land to water and the mountains tremble with onset of community
710663221,oh i think you do see that we are all connected to each other in a circle in a hoop that never ends
710663221,lizzy dances with commies warren is a race hustler who has just hustled her way out of being elected i love karma
710663221,what more people need to be concerned about is what qualifies someone to be a us senator elizabeth warren seems to think that things like being the first woman of color at harvard law school was important enough to lie about and just recentlly she bragged that she was the first woman to ever take the bar exam while nursing a baby don't we already have enough people in the congress already who's priorities and values are totally out of whack why elect yet another one
710663221,indeed which is why we should all do our part to help those we are interconnected with and not outsource that responsibility to a government representative that will put on us our respective reservations and dole the favors to her politically connected tribe as far as supporting her or championing her cause no thanks
710663221,i appreciate your points but it is the government that ensures us access to our entitlements under our constitution for example humans are entitled to easy access to free birth control our declaration of independence affirmed that we are endowed entitled with certain unalienable aliens too documented or not rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and to ensure we get what we are entitled to we instituted a government now without free birth control we may risk life pregnancy has medical consequences unwanted pregnancy certainly inhibits our liberty and you sure can't pursue happiness hook up if you're worried about unwanted pregnancy or how to pay for its prevention it our president is a constitutional scholar so he recognized this governmental gap and closed it it's really that simple forward
710663221,then some of you should have thought before getting bush and multi lie cheney into office speaking about lies and injuring other via gaming the system blood for oil those two should go to prison with the blood of thousands on their hands don't think warren's native blood is going to make a difference one way or another when it comes to help the middle class lacking character or having problems with honesty the whole house is filled with liars and criminals
710663221,what a pack of lies from freedom fighter bet you have never fought in a war yet big name for nothingness she wants to help the middle class
710663221,they should have maybe stayed where they were
710663221,you need to re read my first post and heed it's warning put the rye down and take a astep back that filthy hooch has blinded you
710663221,to quote drinkeroftherye she's native american because she feels native american that's like bill clinton saying he's black because he feels black that's like al gore saying there's global warming because he feels hot when he has the heat turned up too high in his estate that's like nancy pelosi saying she knows the constitution and that's why obamacare will pass the supreme court that's like black voters saying they vote for obama not because of the color of his skin but because he's qualified give me a frikin break and get off the liberal crackpipe
710663221,stop drinking start thinking she should tell the truth or research her heritage for goodness sakes heck im related to charlemagne napolean ghengis khan and billy dee williams hehe im a minority give me extra privileges im a super citizen
710663221,we gave her a chance she danced around the issue she needs to come clean on her either fabrication or documented geneology
710663221,you should feel like your from alaska in spirit dont they still get royalty checks each year
710663221,warren admits she's 'concerned' about her campaign in wake of heritage controversy you know when will people figure out that things work out better when you tell the truth and choose not to 'play games' jef
710663221,you either elect someone that's going to protect americans against corporate greed or you vote for the guy that is helping the red corporate republican't slice up the american dream and feed it to the corporate boardroom one has to ask why the american corporations are sitting on trillions of profits as they don't hire cut workers wages and outsource jobs to foreign sweatshops it's the republican't plantation syndrome that inspires the republican't right to work for less destruction of the unions and tax breaks for shipping jobs to foreign sweatshops
710663221,i feel that bush cheney ought to be in guantanamo their economic terrorism that bankrupt this country and was applauded by all the red corporate republican'ts have cut the american workers wages by and raised corporate managements wages that's what i feel
710663221,it's not whether you're a one or ninety nine percenter all of us should be unencumbered to use our dream catchers and summon our spirit walk without the rules of the white man after all we once trusted the government of the white man and his papers of peace through those nefarious tools he blew like the north wind through the nations now all we are left with are his casinos and tax exempt cigarette sales
710663221,why does warren hoard her million why not give all her millions to charity hypocrisy isnt it and you are such a fraud you defend her
710663221,thanks to your unions son
710663221,funny thing that russell b but i feel that you are delusional and packed full of false left wing redundant i know talking points that only other professional dissemblers believe how do we cut that diamond
710663221,sarcasm is wasted on some people drinkeroftherye is fing awesome
710663221,it better not have been
710666195,get government interference out of our lives
710666195,no problem with less government but what about oversight who is going to see that disadvantage children are being educated as well as those more fortunate who is going to see that public money is used for public education who is going to see that schools are provided for equally and not the way it has been done in penn and wisconsin this past year some government has been so criminal in the past couple of years it would be best to get it out of education and to get rid of it altogether
710666195,suppose you have thought about infrastructure and how you would continue the upkeep parks military public buildings protection all the things you take for granted government is needed in a civilized working world knowing you are a military person a bit of trivia even in death camps and hostage situations people have formed small 'governments' to keep organized focused with the sense of well being that a group brings
710666195,we need our military our police our fire protection and very little else how much money are we wasting on illegal aliens lazy sponges on welfare welfare queens and all the worthless government agencies right now gsa hhs etc etc etc etc
710686622,people have been granted immunity close to walker have been charged with felonies this sounds like it is a den of crime with the king pin campaigning to remain governor it is only a matter of time before they come for the big fish
710686622,when you go negative it's pretty much over walker will win the recall and wisconsin will move on with life though many democrats will remain lost in the past and delude themselves that they hold a popular position maybe the left will have better luck attacking joe arpaio in arizona though in fact if they spend money on that they will lose claire mccaskill in missouri
710692865,if this lady can get all the benefits of a minority person based on a th part american indian blood i think maybe it's time to renew the whole birther controversy about obama's legitimacy to be president
710692865,i am a certified cherokee and believe me there are no benefits if you could enlighten me as to the advantages i would appreciate it
710692865,getting a tenured teaching position at harvard is certainly a benefit tonto
710692865,elizabeth warren are all liars liberal or are all liberals liars which comes first
710692865,i am a taxpayer where are my benefits
710692865,did you know that the leader of cherokee nation is the same percentage cherokee as she is maybe that's why they are not outraged get over it
710692865,setting aside the factual misstatements in this blog post i'm more interested in the broader question no one is asking is the purpose of minority benefits to give them only to those who look like minorities i propose that every person who has raised the issue including this blog's author take a good hard look at their own procilivities towards bigotry bias and discrimination because it seems to me that judging someone worthy of a job a college admission or of a benefit based on whether they look like they belong to a particular minority group is the definition of discrimination
710692865,she's a liar and a cheat the perfct democrat
710692865,until you get past your cowardliness teamocil of hiding in a dark closet when you blog hiding your name so that you don't have to be responsible must be a republican't for the hatred and racism you spew from that chit eating mouth of yours no one will care what you and the karl rove propaganda machine has to say if you can t take responsibility for your own words then your worthless

710692865,minorities are made minorities by the destruction of their rights land home support system and population the american indian and canadian eskimo have lost almost everything due to foreigners greed something that has been done to every group everywhere since the beginning of the human race at least now we apologize and give some of our pirates booty as compensation the old sorry i killed three generations of your family here have some free spam and crackers
710692865,i really pisses off you statist freaks that people are now able to speak freely without being attacked by a pc speech police leftist mob well tough shit russ
710692865,save the bleeding heart talking points lady race hustling is just a big scam and everybody knows it
710692865,yeah but he didn't screw someone else who was truly a minority out of enrollment at harvard
710692865,her credentials do not qualify her to teach at renowned institutions like hardvard and the university of pennsylvania clearly she got there through falsely claiming to be a so called minority
710692865,your statement is factually incorrect elizabeth warren is not native american she is not native american she is zero percent native american the so called great great great grandmother warren claimed was cherokee is listed in all official records and documents as white she has absolutely no proof of any native american heritage anywhere in her family tree what has been verified is that her white great great great grandfather rounded up native americans for the trail of tears march in which thousands of indians died elizabeth warren has utterly destroyed her credibility with her misleading and downright untrue statements on this issue consider the record since this scandal broke warren has repeatedly stated that being native american is part of who i am it's my family history yet when asked to provide a biography for the oklahoma hall of fame in a bio specifically focused on her heritage warren made no mention whatsoever of any indian heritage she did however say she could trace her oklahoma roots on both sides back to the mid s why then is she unable to provide proof of indian ancestry consider also that earlier this year when a boston globe reporter accompanied warren to oklahoma for a word article on her upbringing at no time did warren ever mention any native american heritage even more telling this woman who claims to be so proud of her alleged indian heritage so much so that she listed herself in minority recruitment directories allegedly to meet others like her never once attended or participated in any native american events at harvard which even has its own annual powwow the only times in fact that warren has ever expressed any connection to native american heritage was when it would benefit her career in faculty recruitment directories and on ivy league job applications she is a pretender of the worst kind someone who has embellished and fabricated a history to which she is not entitled to further her own ambitions and by refusing to accept responsibility for her actions or address this controversy directly and honestly she has shown herself to be unworthy of the voters' trust
710692865,just male american indians out of job interviews shame shame shame
710692865,you mean like ward churchill another liar warren cheated and should be fired by harvard
710692865,you got a bunch of cheaters d and parasites who are killing the usa owebama van jones pelosi liealot warren ward churchill jesse jackson billy ayers anita dunn bwarney fwrank solyndra govt motors afscme
710692865,my parent's generation did include almost compulsively stories about native american heritage in family lore much gets written about appropriation of conquered people first it's their land of course and effects meaning their wealth and or ability to produce a living afterwards curiously and this got my interest hearing it conservation enters into the picture only after the conquered people are completely subdued and no longer pose a threat of any significance yes after we annihilated the indians we set about making sure they wouldn't disappear and in fact attempted to turn them into our own antiquity to rival europe's known antiquity of rome and greece hence an indian graces the top of the capitol dome an attempt for us describe a uniquely us history with equal credibility attempt to preserve cultural ways will include supporting tourism helped industries of traditional indian goods perceived to be blankets in this case woven and earthen ware and so forth kind of pathetic although indians have also been represented various ways re sherman alexie that changes with time 's they were hallucinogen takers in the 's they were eco warriors as princess pocahauntus not being cute here it's the facts forgetting the unpleasantry of the story of pocahauntus john smith and her terrible death upon leaving her ancestral home this leads us to me my family said we were direct descendants no less of pocahauntus every family had this in their lore given the area of the country we came from it may actually be of some validity in that everyone remarried inter married and that was that now on one side of the family my mother's side who also told the story my grandfather was a tall mysterious very very indian trait along with being a silent man with flat black hair and a copper forehead in those days you didn't smile in photographs so much as now when everyone just looks stupid with hilarity at all times so elizabeth warren is right it's a part of lore but she has a serious serious problem she stretched it a long time ago trying to get some kind of 'fair' shake at the billionaire's club at harvard
710692865,one thing that strikes me as strange is how concerned some folks are on here about minorities and representation when you wouldn't normally associate them with advocacy on this issue i'm speaking of conservatives of course of the current extremist variety it does me good to hear some complain about any time a minority is denied their affirmative action position as they perceive it she took some disadvantaged person's affirmative action position and that's just wrong shame they write but pressed in the next breath they have no problem backing disadvantaged white males trying to get those affirmative action positions already designated for minority hires blocked and given to their white constituents as if they hated affirmative action how emotionally incoherent and stormy the insides of such a soul must be torn approach tot he world living in one person must be a lot to deal with a nd i come away today with renewed sympathy for the

710714427,i agree but it was in the blue fin tuna

710714427,while sugar like anything else in excess is not a good thing however obesity is rooted in the psyche self esteem inability to see a way out and the resignation folks fall to think there's any connection with the economic downturn of the past five years and the obesity statistics how many unemployed do you see that are fit these folks just don't get it it's the economy and we're not stupid

710714427,i could not be more upset with my fellow republicans right now reading all over internet how they blame boehner over holder and fast and furious how can you be so ignorant about why it is being dropped we are known for doing our homework except for this the dem senate alresdy said it would not pass to keep going against holder his hands were tied by the dems do not blame boehner
710714427,what concerns me is why he doesn't change his name to baynor clearly if you pronounce his name phonetically he is boner gawd idiot america
710714427,lack of evidence are the ties that bind boehner
710714427,this is not a unique issue the blue fin tuna have cesium from the nuclear testing that idiot america etc were doing for decades now it's fold from fuca and prepare it will be much worse soon
710714427,weiner was dispensable why not an accessory to murder just more proof at how corrupt the democrats are
710714427,yeah well you may like bloomberg boehner but most american's believe he is is a blooming idiot maybe he should work on his states debt a little bit more and stop sweating the small stuff it only makes him look like a nut job it is not his freaking business what people drink or eat he is not god like someone else we know
710714427,and you thought new yorkers were a holes before wait till they can't get their sugar fix
710714427,so if i want to drink ounces i need to buy two oz drinks that's going to cost me more money
710714427,and if you are fascist as you are we should send you to cuba is not any of your business if somebody is fat or skinny according to your rational anorexics or bullimics would fall under that category too because they are costing you money on health care related illness if you could do that and deny health care to any who is fat you would be called racist because you would be denying millions of minorities health care plus the people of no fault of their own that are natural fat heck you might have some in your own family that are fat and are problably in welfare since you are a liberal did you know that liberal democrats passed a law that makes alchoholism and drug addiction a desease do you know how many billions of dollars you spend when these parasites applied for disability benefits every single year most of these parasites are not fat either but you wil pay when they eventualy get skinny sick remember this is still a free country and we don't need for you to take my god given rights so you can save me that can only happen in totalitarian countries
710714427,bloomberg has lost touch with reality and should be given his walking papers he should move to a country where he can run for dictator we don't need or want a nanny here up with choice down with rations
710714427,cry me a river boehner if you got checks from somebody lobbying for this ban you'd be all for it while you pass out the checks on the house floor
710714427,bloomberg and his cola war is typical obama policy these democratic idiots have nothing else to do other than go to war over soft drinks people in nyc can't think or make decisions on their own they need bloomberg and the government to do that for them what an idiot but bigger idiots are the people in nyc who go along with it with not much more that a yawn
710714427,the real problem with dems liberals you ready cause this explains most of it they have no concept that their powers their reach into our lives is limited by that pesky consitution thing they jump from this sounds like a good idea to lets do it without ever asking the fundamental question does the government have the power to do this their second problem is that most of their good ideas are stupid
710714427,fantastic response and comment
710714427,the mills of liberal idiocy grind exceedingly fine hold your breath new york if bloomberg is serious about this taxing big gulps out of existance comes next
710714427,the conservatives have done more to reach into our lives then any party it was bush who falsely claimed that the intrusive patriot act was needed to protect us not to mention telling women what they can and can't do with their own bodies boehner needs to take a lesson from david cameron who said he supports gay marriage not in spite of being a conservative but because he is a conservative what people do in the privacy of their bedroom is not my business as long as it doesn't harm me
710714427,boehner and ryan haven't you bigger issues to deal with than beverage regs in a city in a state that is not ohio or wisconsin how about un gridlocking congress for example let the voters of nyc decide what they want to do about mayor bloomberg and you two just go mind your own business

710714427,go to fox news insiders top right corner
710714427,yeah aren't there more page programs around that boehner has to cut
710714427,this is not about 'big gulps' or 'sugared drinks' it's about the gov't being able to 'enforce their will' on citizens to that i say no jeff

710714427,boehner has to be the stupidest asshole to ever to hold the house speaker's position he's complaining about bloomberg and he's trying to stop the fast and furious investigation
710714427,boehmer is worried about bloomberg's stupid moves and he is trying to stop the investigation into fast and furious really has his priorities correct
710714427,i'm think boehmer is doing a monica on obama
710714427,correction to my last post i'm thinking that boehmer is doing a monica on obama
710714427,bloomberg needs to be more worried about the big gulp that happened on wall street today where the averages dropped and wiped out all the gains for the year
710714427,boehner is the worst republican speaker in history give us back gingrich at least he has the gonads to fight the democraps

710714427,i love how big government criticizes local government like they think they know better the people attacking bloomberg are the big government lovers
710714427,exactly statism knows no party lines
710714427,can anyone tell me why republicans are attacking the decision of a local government i thought republicans respected local government and why is boehner an agent of the federal government trying to get involved

710714427,nazi's kill jews bloomberg suggested that if you wqant oz of soda you get two smaller cups a little bit of a difference perhaps if you weren't such a complete jizzstain
710714427,that's local government suck it up buttercup you wantz de smokes then you can help pay for anti smoking initiatives in nyc smokingisterrible if you want to drive on the local roads as a non ny taxpaying foreigner you can donate some money via tolls to help maintain them us rooster is a fiscally irresponsible american citizen
710714427,uh last i checked this is a local government issue lolz detroit guy did you ever ask why the patriot act was authorized in the first place just curious why you didn't ask demint or bachmann about it why is that lolz that's the problem with republicans they claim they are for smaller government except when trans vaginal probes is mentioned or you know who you can marry is mentioned constitutionalammendment areyouseriousbro republicans like liberals are big government they just want their will imposed on americans
710714427,and while obama reauthorized it which i think he shouldn't have why did demint bachmann ryan pence noem boehner all vote yes on this why because i'll tell you conservatives love big government they just want their version of big government at least i can respect the ron paul libertarian supporters the true ones are for anything that results in more freedom regardless of politics
710714427,except this is a local government issue
710714427,you're too stupid to mention that when you have type diabetes and on medicare everyone will be paying for you so why should you be personally irresponsible
710714427,except he's a republican by the way and this is a local government issue you cry like a chick
710714427,totally explains why republicans want to dictate who you can marry because you know the american left despise freedom wang newton is dumb like a jizzstain and by the way wang why did boehner demint ryan pence etc vote in favor of the patriot act reauthorizations legislation that shreds the th ammendment wang newton where were you complaining about that i get that obama signed it and he shouldn't have but why did your own small government loving leaders vote yes on it this makes you unrespectable and a partisan hypocrite wahhhhh keep crying sucker
710714427,last i checked this was a local government issue do you really think the federal government should involve itself in local government issues
710714427,trying to avoid those doctor visits to begin with america is too fat
710714427,except that bloomberg was last a republican lolz l t u is just another hypocrite
710714427,perhaps if americans weren't dumber than jiz stains in regards to their eating habits then perhaps just perhaps it would not be needed
710714427,perhaps if nyc'ers were more personally responsible with their eating habbits this local law might not be needed
710714427,who said it will please explain stephenusa lolz
710714427,so this is a local government decision and now you're complaining about it wahhhhh it's only because you don't get your way

710714427,yeah it's all about obamacare gotta control everything we do eat drink sleep drive 'cause if obamacare is found constitutional it'll be about the gov't's cost of health care control control control taxes taxes taxes
710714427,don't confuse political party with personal ideology parties change their stripes

710714427,romney is on record as raising lots of taxes and loving mandates how is he not a messican usurper again
710714427,l t u can't even sign your own name to your content so why should anyone believe what you say to be true just callin you out for being a coward
710714427,us rooster how am i wrong please explain if you can show me how i am wrong i will retract and issue an apology
710714427,lolz what menu where you do realize pricing will obviously change to work around this right omg i saved a nickel by buying twice the amount in the same cup seriously
710714427,and this is a local government issue you know what 'small government' is right that's right this is coming from the supporter of the party of a constitutional ammendment to ban gay marriage lolz c mstains like you make me laugh you want your version of big government imposed at least the ron paul fans aren't hypocritical that way
710714427,i think all restaurants have menus if you don't see it ask an employee where it is price change is not obvious there has been no mention of changing prices the savings is closer to than to a nickel if you save a dollar once a week that's a year to me that is a lot of money
710714427,let me mark my calendar june lonestar ray agreed with lloyd c wow i don't even like soft drinks and certainly not sweet tea i don't really care what they do in nyc because of not living there bloomberg can mandate anything within the scope of his authority and it's ok with me
710714427,you totally don't mention how repulbicans want to tell you what youc an smoke and who you can marry so why won't you just admit that both sides want to take away your freedom lolz let's bring up the patriot act re authorizations if small government loving conservatives didn't want big government why did demint and bachmann and ryan and boehner all vote yes us rooster is just another hypocrite partisan pooseyboy i'm not telling you this because i'm a liberal i'm a centrist i'm calling you out on this for not admitting that your own side does the same thing
710714427,if you and i can agree on something like this then i do have a shred of hope for america now i'm not saying that this isn't a stupid tax not with starbucks and deli's in ny serving up pounds and pounds of cholesterol and fat filled foods i kept hearing about 'sweet tea' on the radio country music fan and i looked up a recipe it's like sugar wtf man americans need to get over their obsession with sugar and fatty food unless you have a super low blood sugar count obviously it's amazing how two weeks of fresh fruit and exercise and water can change someone's sleeping habits
710714427,at least he voted against the patriot act reauthorizations why do you give your republicans a pass on that
710714427,any restaurants i go to even nice fairly healthy ones the crap soda pop is free refils
710714427,interesting comment what will happen to refills if restaurants are prohibited from serving more than oz per order
710714427,i don't see what you're complaining about all products should be regulated by government bloomburg needs to add regulations if they don't already exist to regulate inspect tax and license those nasty little snot nosed neighborhood brats and their card tables on the sidewalk lemonade stands who knows what's in the lemonade jar charity bake sales grandma can't remember where she is let alone what she puts into those sugar filled creamy made from scratch instead of government inspected mass produced cake mixes it's an epademic waiting to happen food drives all food to the neady should be inspected by the government each package and can should be opened and tested before allowing anyone to consume it remember the tylenol scare years ago surely some do gooder will taint the food the poor must be protected garbage dumsters all dumpsters in nyc and elsewhere must be inspected at least daily to insure the health of dumpster divers the federal government should pass laws or quicker still institute new regulations thus by passing congress to require all state county and municiple governments including school districts to impliment stringent rules regarding what people eat and who may prepare all foodstuffs including petfood as well as where and when new studies show that food consumption timing can have a great effect on weight regulation they can eat regulations by homeland security department of education department of agriculture the cdc and etc the list is endless government have not begun to use their potential for proper control in this important and meaningfull endeavor
710714427,boehner criticizing bloomie for worrying about insignificant items like soft drinks when he is ignoring things like project gun runner gsa spending hundreds of thousands of tax dollars on parties and the present administration stomping on the constitution boehner is a real piece of crap and if he is the best the republican party can offer as house speaker we might as well cancel all future election as a waste of time and money and go the the nearest blacksmith and get fitted for ball and chains we are destined to wear if this charade is allowed to continue
710714427,now that is an interesting question i believe refils would still be free because you generally bought food with that drink right
710714427,like lloyd c tells anyone who you are
710714427,but what about those who are responsible about their eating they're just legally 'stuck' that 'fair' personally i don't think so when the majority have to abide by laws designed to 'control' a minority well maybe i better not go there jeff
710714427,someone way less of a coward than you coward why should i reward you for your own personal irresponsibility and jiz stain intelligence
710714427,boehner this is a nyc and ny state issue you are an ohio rep let the opposition in albany do its job okay
710714427,you do realize if you paid the same rate i pay you'd have universal healthcare right you wouldn't go bankrupt if you found a lump my co pay is what a month ish give or take
710719667,the dnc ran the state treasurer of nevada on an anti ryan plan platform and lost in the reno nevada the demographically oldest district in the us special congressional election in september by an pt landslide after which chief of staff bill daley and domestic policy advisor melody barnes were fired if the dnc wants to repeat the same losing campaign strategy in arizona they will inevitably face the same result
710719667,untrue btw your boy kelly is a tard
710719667,the man in the ad is over nobody has suggested that we eliminate his medicare part a however what he should be worried about is where the money is going to come from to pay for it part a will be going broke shortly after he retires and he isn't paying for part b with his medicare taxes part b comes out of general revenue it isn't enough to just create a straw man by lying about what your opponent said ron barber needs to present his plan for medicare i have heard nothing specific
710733395,this outing by the wh shows exactly how panicked prez obie and his henchmen are that they have to exclaim everything they can think up just to prove obie is doing something obie should be kicked out of office for making public secret military actions against an enemy yet he gets a pat on the back from the press i'm not sure our country can take more months of this momo
710733395,stfu moron only clinton and obama tried to kill the mastermind of not your gay hero bush
710733395,only four countries had the technical know how to develop the flame virus israel the u s china and russia since the virus was obviously intended for iran we can eliminate its friends china and russia this leaves only israel and us having thoroughly demonized iran anything we do to it has become fair game but there is nothing fair or right about taking another country's data certainly we would not want china or russia taking our data and spreading it to separate servers as a leader of the world community aspiring for governance through universal fairness we can no longer afford to follow the beaten path of expediency chosen by israel doing so will not only deprive us of our moral authority but will also squander our unique opportunity to fashion a more just and fair world
710733395,the obama administration is giving away classified information revealing our cyber war methods and endangering people in the field someone put that code in those machines and may now be compromised in the same way the pakistani doctor who helped us id obl there are a lot of iranians who hate their government and are trying to help us stop their nuclear weapons program and prevent an attack when our elected officials expose sources and methods for political gain they should be defeated at the polls and charged with a felony
710733395,so obama who bashed bush for everything merely continued bush's policies how is that hope and change was the smartest man that ever lived unable to come up with something different than the guy he called a dummy
710733395,another stupid comment from left field
710733395,romney simply meant do it but stop talking about it on national tv you have no clue what your even talking about seal team six was bush's idea and was also the reasons he made the decisions he did in tora bora and the alec unit stop spewing your bulls t when you have no clue
710733395,like fr ances resp onded i am in sho ck that p eople able to make in mon th on the com puter did you lo ok at t his we bpa ge c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k

710733395,it is time to find the leakers and i believe the charge is treason if it is the man at the top so be it nov th can not come one day to soon god bless america
710733395,it is time to find the leakers and i believe the charge is treason if it is the man at the top so be it nov th can not come one day to soon god bless america
710733395,fact youu do realize that obama retains power until mid january for his first term and mid january fr this second term i hope you don't seriously think a light weight like romney could win
710733395,fact its seven more months not five moron
710733395,fact was that even english
710733395,whovever leaked this needs to be shot on national television
710733395,while offering no apologies or support for iran's 'masters' this is an act of war so let's stop kidding ourselves willful disclosure of this information would be a violation of his whomever's oath and should be subject to federal prosecution btw enough with the while iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only already there is only one purpose for highly enriched uranium and it 'ain't' peaceful
710733395,is there karma in cyberspace
710733395,take a few more tokes and don't worry about it
710733395,then you should be able to prove it

710733395,new york times is committed to destroying this country with it's reporting
710733395,obama has been a looney lame duck since nov his alinsky pig squeal is now a whisper and nobody hears or believes obama and his lies
710733395,doubtful obama wins are you paying any attention last time i checked the person blaming everyone else is obama read the healines on the looney left web sites obama is synonym for the word failure in the new webster dictionary

710733395,sure idiot bogy let's just ignore what romney plainly said and pretend that he meant something else
710733395,clinton didn't refuse obl this was before when we followed laws and the constitution and obl hadn't been indicted for any crime yet so there was no basis for clinton to accept him so stfu moron only clinton and obama tried to kill the mastermind of not your gay hero bush
710733395,page margin in p margin bottom in strategically speaking this was as dumb as it gets if your not smart enough to know when you use such a tactic you give your adversary a fully functioning weapon thats real dumb if your not smart enough to know that your not smart enough to understand how it can be used against your own assets if this is how the defense budget is being spent to supply people that are viewed as a threat by giving them technology for free no wonder higher taxes are needed first to build weapons to give to foes then we need to protect our own assets from our own weapons more taxes makes you wonder with such childish thinking and a complete lack of forward strategical understanding should these same minds develop kill lists the economy hasn't done all that well these same minds gave a huge amount of money to a solar power company to go bankrupt fast and furious on and on i guess university doesn't teach you all that you need to be at least when it means saving lives who needs enemies when there seems to be so much domestic threat masquerading as the protectors from the threat they seemingly create i'm seriously questioning the competency perhaps mr p in the dod should look at being smarter money cant buy smarts you either got it or you dont evidently degrees cant even guarantee that someone has what it takes tax payers shouldn't be expected to pay for epic mistakes and stupidity given some folks salaries making decisions they should be paying the tax payer back not demanding more
710733395,yeah clinton refused obl then did some bs bombing of an empty camp what a buffoon obl didn't commit a crime you dumba pos he commited an act of war we don't need a warrant so why don't you stfu you fat stupid bastard bend over to the muslims like your gay savior bottom boy

710749345,seize on this is just the continuation of failed policy after failed policy
710749345,bs the senate sits on all the proposals passed by the house go back to kos or whatever retarded place you came from
710749345,this morning s jobs report shows that congressional republicans do nothing confrontation over compromise approach to jobs isn t working the second ranking house democrat minority whip steny hoyer md said in a statement while the president and democrats in congress have been promoting a jobs first agenda to provide certainty to american businesses and workers republicans continue to avoid addressing serious job creation in favor of ideological bills nice try steny hahahahaha
710749345,oh it has been so long since i had the joy of reading your drivel ha moron alert
710749345,this country is in desperate need of an executive that can lead and not one who not only is totally lacking in any leadership skills but has no planning skills either his economic stimulus plan plan a didn't work so what is his plan b do plan a all over again
710749345,when did democrats have all branches for years i missed that
710749345,it's a good thing that the house republicans have been so focused on job creation oh never mind that's right the house republicans have been focused on abortions because we all know how many jobs that will create zero
710749345,plan a pose preen lie set federal agencies on private companies prop up failed industries whose ceos give you money plan b pout pose preen lie go to fund raisers see plan a
710749345,oh shut up moron the house has send budgets to the senate which by the way retard is controlled by the dems and they have sat on them now go crawl back into that hole where the rest of the deluded left live
710749345,obama clearly has failed and it's not just gop leaders who are properly frustrated at obama's stunning incompetence if obama had any class or integrity he would stop playing so much golf admit that he is over his head apologize to the american people and announce that he is not running for a nd term
710749345,the house republicans blocked almost all of the president's jobs plans but they can get away with blaming him for them obama should have listened to paul krugman when he said we needed a stimulus package half again larger than the one obama requested so if he loses in november it's on him
710749345,the teabaggers are dancing for joy you've really got obama where you want him and the rest of america suffers while you play politics
710749345,moron gf said nothing about budget blah blah blah blah blah blah
710749345,the lefties moron trollsl are out in force blaming this on the republicans what a crew of cry baby losers go back to the hell hole of what you call your party retard you comments are just as stupid as you probably look
710749345,you have to take out the trash before you can clean the house
710749345,and dem leaders took any and every opportunity whether it actually existed or not to crucify bush and apparently he's still not off the hook
710749345,he said that the republican never mind jerk you and your ilk are lost to logic and morality anyway a waste of time to try to talk to an amoral leftist about anything jeezuz the lefty trolls are out here drooling all over themselves today
710749345,so the next time you catch yourself voting your conscience or rather voting in a person based on a popularity contest remember always this bad result the popular one is a loser who's not qualified for office today's votes are based only on sex and race what way was that ever to be don't vote sex or race
710749345,obama and the dems had control of the presidency house and senate for two years and rammed through the biggest stimulus in history over billion dollars unfortunately it turned out to be more of a porkulus to democrat special interests and friends than a stimulus with even democrat stalwart warren buffett saying half of the stimulus was candy for political interests so this community organizer with no serious administrative or business experience has driven the country towards a debt crises while presiding over the most tepid economic recovery in sixty years it is time we get a president with a legitimate resume in the whitehouse elect romney this november
710749345,steny the whore must be brain dead house republicans have sent budgets programs and ideas to the senate and that a hole harry reid does nothing the problem with this economy lies at the steps of the white house obama's policies have failed and it's time to vote the worst president in the history of america out
710749345,steny hoyer really is anyone still listening to steny hoyer how about princess nancy pelosi i'm confident she has a few pearls of wisdom to share with us the next twenty four hours is going to be rich with progressive humor ca't wait for the late night pundits like super dave he's a real charmer you know always has something constructive to add this is like watching the hindenburg in very slow motion
710749345,summer of reality is knocking on the white house door what will the lonely occupy white house protestor do
710749345,oh yeah just another vast right wing conspiracy obamanomics is a joke and finally most of america is waking up to the fact that they have an empty suit in the white house
710749345,obama should have is that the new campaign theme it is too late to save obama obama is almost finished obama corzine transparent bankrupt
710749345,laughable lies obama got his stimulus for those 'shovel ready' jobs that didn't exit oops yeah if spending your way to prosperity doesn't work double down on stupidity and spend even more
710749345,making political hay out of the jobs report is one thing but washington is on notice by the people come november th things need to change
710749345,thats always the case isn't it libs are drooling knuckle draggers
710749345,your an idiot where is his plan what is he going to do when he can't get votes in the senate how is he going to fix europe asia south america in this global economy moreover if you take away lost of government jobs these past few years because of the republicans the jobs number is significantly better and that is without taking into account the effect of velocity of money
710749345,if obama reelected the death spiral begins and the occupy folks will just take our stuff including our food
710749345,your choom gangsta savior got everything he wanted the stimulus for 'shovel ready' jobs that didn't exist your lies aren't working anymore sorry
710749345,i'm sad to say many of my black friends will be voting for obama becasue he's black these folks are professionals several have harvard degrees and all are figure earners go figure
710749345,tanking the economy worked to empower and put into power the obama reid pelosi socialist revolutionaries of we've been living the victory years of the obama reid pelosi socialist revolution of for five years do you want another five years like we just went through

710749345,hey joe get off it this is the fourth time you've posted this comment maybe a part of the spin talking points huh sorry it ain't gonna work anymore repeating lies never replaces truth
710749345,the last two year of bush bush went along with the obama reid pelosi socialists it is bush's fault obama is our ruler today
710749345,the lonely occupy white house protester is not likely to leave public property peaceably
710749345,liberals are lying swine the house has sent jobs bills that the dim o crit senate has refused to even allow do come to a vote
710749345,fund raisers scheduled for obama the billion dollar man is working everyday to save his own job to he with america
710749345,as nobel prize winning economist paul krugman explained today when the private sector is frantically trying to pay down debt the public sector should do the opposite spending when the private sector can t or won t by all means let s balance our budget once the economy has recovered but not now the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity instead congress driven by a cut happy republican house has pursued austerity leading to hundreds of thousands of public sector job losses last month alone state and local level education jobs disappeared something tea bagger anti government nuts will never agree
710749345,do you libtards really think that if you keep bleating that trash that anyone with an iq over is going to swallow it
710749345,they come out from under their rocks when their hero looks like he is taking another well deserved punch they are so stupid and have lost their sense of direction so much that they say the same lame tired things have you noticed that
710749345,steny oyer he is a joke almost as arrogant and delusional as pelosi
710749345,yeah cause the handouts worked so well in europe stupid is as stupid does
710749345,shocking levels of ignorance are common on the left the dim o crits had the house from ' ' the senate from ' to present and the white house from ' to present
710749345,business won't hire or expand as long as obama is in the white house he has declared war on them and won government always wins at first and now comes the part where no one hires one expands most lay off because they are uncertain and fearful if obama gets re elected it will get worse and all the while people get poorer tax revenue goes down etc
710749345,without state help most towns couldnt balance budget without fed govt most states cant balance budget without fed printing free money federal govt cant balance budget hmmm i see a rather large problem and pattern here how long can this go on before all wind up getting nothing
710749345,where are the questions about that republican jobs act that was passed that has helped out so much
710749345,this is maobama's cue to take another vacation he worked hard for it his goal of making more americans dependent on him worked well last month
710749345,the occupy folks arent the real problem its your neighbors that havent prepared adequately get involved and start gardens plant fruit trees stock up on food etc one facet of a good preparedness plan
710749345,when you have the facts on your side argue the facts when you have the law on your side argue the law when you have neither hoyer
710749345,im seeing a disturbing trend for uninformed folks with harvard degrees someone shoudl look into why they charge so much and give you so little true knowledge they still using the case study method
710749345,in the quest to give all hard working industrious people success this just reaffirms our contention that the obama policies are not working well for usa
710749345,give me my share of the stimulus pie id create jobs give a teacher a job for another year with same money alll i get is an indoctrinated kid
710749345,blame bush is all the socialist party has america and the world see it plain as day president gunrunner downgrade solyndra is a mammoth failure
710749345,so you agree the dim o crits were wrong to block the jobs bills the republicans sent to the senate from even coming up for a vote
710749345,so you agree then the senate dim o crits are wrong to be harming america with partisan politics
710749345,but krugman is a keynesian economist whose theories have been proven wrong for capital markets over and over again remember obama is a nobel prize winner also doesn't mean they know what they're talking about krugman is professor of economics and international affairs at the woodrow wilson school of public intl affairs at princeton and key proponent of obama's income redistribution policies enough said
710749345,mr cantor what have you and boehner done lately or ever to help america recover from bush recession zero you are gleeful that your game plan is working remember you meeting with ryan gingrich and others on the day of obama's inauguration to obstruct every obama administration initiative to fix the bush economy ever since you have been doing just that tank the economy refuse to cooperate with obama and then blame obama you are not coming to this debate about the economy with a clean hand buddy you surely think americans are stupid and wouldn't notice and would reward republicans nonetheless that wouldn't happen in november you can bet on it
710749345,how this goes on is that government must always be county cyclical i e when the economy is going good you cut spending raise taxes and pay down debt this is the biggest issue for years government has not being doing this when the economy is good also right now not a big issue with debtt since it is so cheap debt is costing the government less than inflation
710749345,sam whats the dr for gender studies or phrenology
710749345,harry reid has all the house jobs bills you refr to he has them piled up in hat big government warehouse next to ark of the covenant why do you guys keep blaming the house when the senate doesn't vote on them

710749345,you ask nobel prize winning theorist paul krugman what needs to be done the rest of us will just follow the recall winning get things done governor of wisconsin how to fix things sott walker is creating jobs saving jobs and creating a surplus and doing it right in front of obama's face but you prefer the imaginations of a nytimes wannabe egghead elitist you don't want results you want socialized fairness
710749345,sorry gop i do recall that over the past three plus years you have thrown up every possible roadblock to recovery and now blame obama besides jumping on month to month reports rather than working at the long term shows your lack of understanding and leadership not to mention your dedication to politics and lack of dedication to the country
710749345,really weak gone even for you you see the handwriting on the wall dont you bye bye barack
710749345,can you please show me a series of months where the economy lost k
710749345,reagan got the job done with a split party congress clinton got the job done with a split party congress and then a republican led congress the economic illiterate we have in the whitehouse now couldn't even get the job done with control of the presidency house and senate for his first two year and ongoing control of the senate in his third and fourth year obama has no leadership qualities and his policy prescriptions are fundamentally flawed
710749345,yes it will all be so much better when romney gets in gives more tax breaks to the rich and corporations that ship jobs overseas and throws more people out of work the one expertise he has in business
710749345,sounds like desperation start drinking heavenly and remain drunk through the landslide that is about to hit obama and the progressives on nov th you know it s coming dont you gone
710749345,if of whites voted for romney would that be racism
710749345,no facts to support your stetement huh
710749345,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz desperate people say desperate things
710749345,i think his doctorate is in idiocy
710749345,arent you just a little embarassed to even show up on this site with obamas spectular failures piling up
710749345,just look at the progress in job growth since the a month loss when obama sat down in the oval office
710749345,biko you toss out that number as if it were fact what month or months did we lose k
710749345,so when democrats say republicans are obstructionists that means the repubs wont rubber stamp another dem failure isnt trillion dollar annual deficits years in a row enough failure for progressives
710749345,let me be clearer jumpstart our business startups act or jobs act
710749345,have you looked at krugmans won lost record over the past years google it it will shut your mouth under progressive policies there will never be a boom only a crash and burn like california
710749345,washington blog reports there are million working age americans there are million employed americans only million of the employed americans are working more than hours per week this means that only of all working age americans have a full time job according to the government drones at the bls million americans have chosen to not be in the labor force the highest level in us history the percentage of americans in the work force at is the lowest since and down from a peak of in the difference between these two percentages is million americans the bls reports there are only million unemployed americans in the country down from million in the bls reports the unemployment rate has dropped from in late to today over this time frame the working age population grew by million while the number of employed americans grew by million only a government drone could interpret this data and report a dramatic decline in the unemployment rate since the working age population of the us has grown by million but the actual number of people with jobs has grown only by million and if they reported the unemployment rate today the same way they did during the great depression unemployment would be at only slightly below the level of the 's so what happens to all the people who don t find work they go on disability the wall street journal reported yesterday that social security s disability trust fund will run out of money in four years in it will be amazing if it lasts that long because the disability rolls are growing twice as fast as the employment rolls yes dear reader since the recession ended officially in june for every new person who has found a job two supposedly have been disabled at least they ve been added to the list of people receiving ssid benefits during the nixon administration approximately of the labor force was disabled now it s over of course you can t blame them the feds set up a zombie economy it protects and rewards zombie industries health care that doesn t really make people healthier education that doesn t make them any smarter defense that doesn t make them any more secure and finance that takes the feds money and pockets it bill bonner
710749345,aren't you even more embarrassed to be a shill for the republican party presume you are one of their staffers who posts on this comment section regularly defending a party whose specialty is destroying jobs and creating income inequality see bush scott walker and all the other gop hacks
710749345,i d love to see those sissys try to take my stuff i wouldn t be using rubber bullets
710749345,he's not unemployment today after five trillion debt escalation and a failed stimulous there is no shame or embarrasment here by the democrats anthony weiner wasn't embarrassed just mad at breitbart for getting caught if you were born without a soul the democrat party is the place for you
710749345,so obama cannot be an effective president unless he has super majorities to ram legislation through congress he had that the first two years and we got obamacare which we cant afford and is unconstitutional the stimulus and historic trillion dollar annual deficits i think we will just kick this loser to the curb on nov th
710749345,feck obama steny reid and the rest of the complete da dems
710749345,who the hell is we the people
710749345,how about your hero odumba's promise to have a laser like focus on jobs and the economy his schedule for todays laser like focus is six fundraisers six in one day what is it going to take for people like you to realize you voted for the dumbest guy in the room
710749345,it gets so tiresome reminding you fools that the dems ran everything for obama's first two years when he wasted a trillion on stimulous and ignored jobs to push obamadeathcare through and now republicans are stopping him from doubling down on his failures obama should have given paul ryan a medal the other day
710749345,what abou the twenty jobs bills passed by the house and sent to harry reid reid says the house jobs bills are a bunch of b s if the bills are so bad then harry should let them be voted on oh that's right some of them may actually pass the senate
710749345,this is an old argument no one cares anymore it's dead and ineffective the president is an historic failure a mammoth let down dumber than anyone ever expected you can t get away from it just that obvious america is looking forward looking to close the book on this mistake socialists are constantly looking back focused on the past never forward and if they look forward well no specifics just platitudes president solyndra s socialist party are in perpetual only ifs or look it could have been worse we are on a long journey to an unspecific destination therefore we will never know it when we get there just come along don t ask questions all of these tricks are documented in the book of human history and all end in death misery and poverty shared among the masses spoils to the politically connected and elite few such as cuba americans don t expect drones and useful idiots like yourself to understand as did our founding fathers who warned us of you
710749345,what about the twenty so jobs bills passed by the house if reid thinks theyare that terrible then let them come up for a vote reid is obviously worried that thebills may pass lol
710749345,first two year speaking of illiterate apparently being illiterate is the qualification for being a gop hack
710749345,million fewer americans work today than in until we get thos jobs back the country will continue to stagnate
710749345,well maybe this jobs report will motivate the republicans to do the right things and approve the presidents jobs bill the republican leaders do know they have failed america on jobs right doesn't it concern all you tea baggers that your leaders term used loosely want bad job numbers and want a bad economy
710749345,we don't want to pass his stinkin jobs bill he can sign ours
710749345,the federal government has added over jobs since obama became presdent and the number of federal employees making over k has tripled
710749345,as long as the ideologies of goldman sachs and aipac are the main focus of american politics and the bilderburg group runs america behind the scenes america will always be a debtor slave nation with no national sovereignty the economy will not really improve no matter who is elected because all our economic resources are going to interest on the war debt and can not improve until after the withdrawal of nato from afghanistan and also many american job creators who went bankrupt after the crash of aught eight will be able to get financed by the banks again that are sitting on all that cash
710749345,krugman is nuts with deficts over a trillion a year and trillion in debt krugman thinks we can spend yet another trillion on a stimulus krugman feels that the us should follow the eu since the eu is basically burning down krugman's advice is worthless
710749345,howienica not at all when you tell me what the republicans have done to help to improve the economy along side president obama i'll then consider taking you guys serious until then i'll continue to point out the hypocrisy of the republicans blowing up the economy and not lifting one finger to do anything to help you know kinda like you smelt it you dealt it
710749345,the right wing rants posted today make me laugh obama has done more to restore our economy and deal with the recession and restore balance to our government than these folks can ever admit and he's done it in spite of their obsructionism bush and cronies created this mess and they have fought the pres since day one as he works to fix it in order to be a republican you have to have no memory an ability to rewrite history willingness to twist and distort fact no place for logic in your thought process if all else fails resort to lies and personal attacks remember facts and reason have no bearing on our opinions
710749345,the federal government has never cut the busget since the democrats have promises several time in the 's and 's that if taxes were raised spending would be cut guess what the democrats lied every time
710749345,obama is ready to blame anyone but himself he's been wrong everytime we are a sinking ship and obma is taking us to the wrong end of the poseidon ad you remember what happened to the guys who went that way
710749345,balance liberal code word for redistribution
710749345,patriotic ideals are not shills for anyone true conservatives want everyone to succeed we are not happy with these numbers but they are validation of what we know to be true obamas policies and regulatory czars are not good for the usa very simple
710749345,harry is very afraid to let the senate vote on any of the house passed jobs bills they might actually pass the democrats would have to vote yes otherwise they would get the blame of blocking job creation
710749345,the progressive caliphate will be put down in november hopefully that sleeping midget will sleep sliently and quietly for another years if not we have a lot of guns to put them down with like the parasites they are
710749345,if your focused on the minor things then your missing the big picture in school did you argue every wrong answer you gave
710749345,so what will the president be doing as a result of today's awful jobs report attending count em six fundraisers today keep up the good work mr president
710749345,to small to short sighted i am no fan of the republicans but face fact obama is a regan republican so sad
710749345,ugh can you read a graph january
710749345,but million americanswho had jobs in still can not find a job today until those million jobs come back the country will continue to stagnate
710749345,maybe reid and obama will pass and sign the house jobs bills that have been languishing in dingy harry's inbox
710749345,so you agree then that the dim o crits did the wrong thing by refusing to allow the jobs bills that the republicans sent to the senate to even come up for a vote
710749345,then why won't harry let any of the jobs bills passed by the house come to a vote in the senate oh that's right some of them may pass
710749345,i really love the statement this morning s jobs report shows that congressional republicans do nothing confrontation over compromise approach to jobs isn t working the main problem here is that harry reid and his senate compadres consider compromise to be their way or the highway that is not compromise they want they want total capitulation so they can continue to wreck the economy with their liberal ideoligic nonsense legislation
710749345,the spindown did happen yes at the end of bushes term now the spinup is sort of happening but numbers of jobs created are not commensurate with the trillion in dollars used thats the problem
710749345,maybe reid and obama will pass and sign the house jobs bills that have been languishing in dingy harry's inbox
710749345,at least romney has a plan obama clearly does not have a plan at all romney has a proven track record of creating jobs both at bain capital and as govenor of mass obama will never know how to create a job
710749345,your exactly right the neo conservatives when co opted become pro war pro federal reserve insiders just like the democrats who only utilize us americans as cannon fodder and debt slaves for their masters from europe
710749345,liberals are all ignorant fools and liars your post is even more proof
710749345,obama is always good for a laugh once again mister accountable blames bush but at the same time they say their polcies are working mr president which one of your policies is working name one and mr president the financial collapse started with the repeal of glass steagull and continued with the fillibuster of regulations of fannie mae and freddie mac which you yourself participated in bush had blame yes but you were standing right next to him along with chris dodd and barney frank the one act of repeal under clinton and rubin of glas steagull led to the creation of sub prime lending mortgage backed securities collaterlized debt obligations mark to market rules and credit default swaps forcing banking institutions into risky home mortgage loans only led to riskier financial decisions for banks to make money like they say big risk big reward or big failure the housing bubble was one risk pushed by our government the banks should have left alone what is termed the american dream ihas become our nightmare a nightmare that has affected the worlds economies you knew the problems going in you took the job and you said you knew how to fix it you were hired to make things better and you simply failed and for some out there who need convincing of the health of our economy i have a test convince the federal reserve to raisie interest rates and stop printing money then you will see how fast it goes into a recession right now economists are telling us to buckle up in to months we will slip back into a recession some may say stay positive but how does one do that when you have jobs in may and over million in new jobless claimes with new jobs the government not the solution the government is the problem if you think otherwise look at the us debt clock and realize the government over spent trillion dollars
710749345,johnstone first with reagan there was not this hate and intentional democratic party main purpose to obstruct or block everything reagan did even though it helped the economy second with bill clinton yea the republicans tried the same thing shutdown the gov and work against clinton but the american people spoke and voted their asses out so in the end they had no choice now with president obama the most filabuster in history ungodly obstruction and just flat out blocking every move you guys always want to talk about the total control of both house and senate you are right and that is when president obama was able to pass his legislation and things started turning around then came loosing ma and the house and hence the obstructing and the blocking of everything you can extend your hand to the other side but time and time again they republicans have swatted it down its sad when you cant even get them to vote on their own so called core beliefs mandate healthcare stimulas tax cuts ect ect
710749345,scott walker has enabled cities and towns accross the state to save alot of money previously the teachers were forced to buy health insurance from the union now that private insurance companies can get involved premiums for the teachers ndropped unemployment has also been decreasing and walker is not increasing the staes debt many companies are leaving ill and moving to wisconsin

710749345,how have the r's helped improve the economy along side the president that's like asking what have you done to help ted bundy murder more women you don't help someone kill more jobs you offer alternative plans and send them to the senate like paul ryan has done and watch harry reid refuse to vote on them why doesn't obama skip his next golf game and go sit down with scott walker and ask him how he's been so successful so fast no sooner have republicans started running wisconsin jobs are created saved and a surplus is created tell o'dumba to put ego aside and beg walker for help
710749345,during the last half of the bush administration we were losing jobs per month so now we gained last month in a hot political climate with republicans deliberately obstructing job creation
710749345,you base your argument on the false premise that obama's been successful he has at ruining the economy on purpose what you call a roadblock is actually not allowing obama to double his failure you should go visit paul ryan and offer him a big sloppy lewinski for keeping obama from destroying your country
710749345,actually the economy tanked six or seven months after the dim o crits took over congress in ' btw no one with an iq over is swallowing your lies anymore
710749345,q what do you call job obstruction a harry reid's inbox
710749345,no i dont agree those jobs bills were deregulation bills to help the repubs satisfy their commitments to their big business donors ie bought and paid for by the koch bros that is all
710749345,to nice job president pothead a er anyone who would vote for this liar clown is a dope
710749345,did i say federal government i said government i e include state and local
710749345,all politics is partisan the biggest issue is when people don't aggree on facts and history their are some good liberal ideas and some good conservative ideas with attacking issues if they can aggree on the real issue i also think that the biggest issue is the same anwser does not always work why can politicians give honest for one i want them to lay out who or what something helps what it also hurts and the net net is better
710749345,i think this is a poor campaign strategy on the dim o crits part people who are dumb enough to believe the agitprop you are posting are generally not smart enough to read much less use a computer
710749345,i don't even see an analysis on thehill of this jobs report or a note of the downward revisions previous two i would like to see some reporting on the reports not just the spurious quotes hell sad thing is that the people posting comments usually have great information on that sort of thing as long as you use about the same amount of circumspection as when reading the actual reporting funny that
710749345,when you gonna start posting the dump obama nuggets maybe you're one of the true believers and your custom designed graph makes me feel much better about paying more taxes with less disposable income at least i still have a job right
710749345,very true
710749345,yeah you liberals class war on one hand and a perverted version of morning in america on the other i can't wait to see that obama commercial that tells me how good i have it
710749345,mr cantor what have you and boehner done lately or ever to help america recover from bush recession zero you are gleeful that your game plan is working remember your famous meeting with ryan gingrich and others on the day of obama's inauguration to obstruct every obama administration initiative to fix the bush economy ever since you have been doing just that tank the economy refuse to cooperate with obama and then blame obama you are not coming to this debate about the economy with a clean hand buddy you surely think americans are stupid and wouldn't notice and would reward republicans nonetheless that wouldn't happen in november you can bet on it
710749345,i think this is a poor campaign strategy on the dim o crits part people who are dumb enough to believe the agitprop you are posting are generally not smart enough to read much less use a computer
710749345,and have their radicals point a finger at those who have submitted over jobs bills to harry reid has he brought them to a vote hoyer is not a the buck stops here kind of guy who's watch is this anyway steny the democrat senate under harry reid has been an insult to our intelligence they seek to hide the truth from the american people good luck with that pathetic and disrespectful goal we're onto the lies and subterfuge
710749345,dr d khead how many jobs bills do they have to send hairy ss reid before he decides to vote on them where in the constitution does it say the house alone can pass bills and since obama spent a trillion bucks accomplishing nothing except ruin the economy why give him more tax dollars to finish the job and make unemployment if someone raped your mother would you try to heal her by asking the rapist to rape her again
710749345,the recession was caused by the democratic congress stead fast hold on a failed idealogy and forceing banks to lend money to those who had no possible way of repaying while ignoring the bush administration's warnings of a massive impending crisis as far as who is obstructing which congerssional leader is holding off voting on over dozen jobs bills because they are from the other side of the isle which side of the isle in the same breath admits the debt and deficit is a spending problem and wants to rais the debt limit spend and tax more without compromise which party spent years doing nothing for the economy and jobs while forcing thru a healthcare law in the middle of the night on christmas eve behind locked doors that not only is unconstitutional but no one wanted you my friend and all other obama followers realy need to look at what is going on liberism has failed and will always fail wake up furthermore democrates had the presidency the senate and the house for years republicas could not have stoped anything
710749345,all you commies can do is blame bush this has been obama s economy for more than years and you can not name one program of his that has worked he in a percent failure
710749345,yours wont do a blanking thing the only jobs yours will create are republican politicians and we dont need that
710749345,put your 'avatar' on ice
710749345,the gop leadership is simply amazing they caused this mess in the first place and are standing in the way of fixing it but they act like it's not their fault that we decided bringing down the president is more important then doing the damn job they were elected to do i am sick of the gop and hope they all lose all these a holes can do is bash the pres with nothing in return and if they do try and offer an idea it always has some insane add on they have been shown over and over again to lie about anything that comes out of their mouth and have no solutions of their own so they make up crap gop grand obstructionist party what a disgrace
710749345,caused by the dem congress are you nuts jesus man you are very misinformed your so out of it i am not even going to continue
710749345,yes it was the democrates fault and the republican house is trying to do the job the were elected to do harry is not putting the house bills to a vote of them i guess you forgot about the huge landslide election in were republicans took the house back because the rest of the country knows democrates caused this mess and had both houses and the presidency did nothing did not even pass a budget with total control talk about a do nothing congress also in republicans took a recorord number of gubernatorial races your short memory alsoforgets the way congress treated bush all they did was bash ever herd of the comunity reinvestment act barney frank chris dodd countrywide fannie and freddie
710751671,can't believe the justice department took on that case and has left wall street alone something stinks
710755066,only four countries had the technical know how to develop the flame virus israel the u s china and russia since the virus was obviously intended for iran we can eliminate its friends china and russia this leaves only israel and us having thoroughly demonized iran anything we do to it has become fair game but there is nothing fair or right about taking another country's data certainly we would not want china or russia taking our data and spreading it to separate servers as a leader of the world community aspiring for governance through universal fairness we can no longer afford to follow the beaten path of expediency chosen by israel doing so will not only deprive us of our moral authority but will also squander our unique opportunity to fashion a more just and fair world
710755066,once again obama followed the lead established by gw bush when bush ordered the cyber attack of the stuxnet virus against iran's nuclear program we must always remember obama has never had an original thought he only knows how to mimic
710772008,ten years of tax cuts for the repub job creators and this is all ther better they can do what crap it is time for all of them to pay their fair share of taxes and let the government create a million infrastructure jobs the bush job creators had their chance
710772008,government isn't helping government jobs cuts are worsening the jobs picture the federal government shed jobs in may state governments and local governments cut overall governments have cut jobs in of the past months tax collections by state and local governments have been rising since mid yet the belt tightening continues from january through march government cuts reduced u s economic growth by percent point to an annual pace of just percent typically the government offers a base level of support when the economy is weak says scott brown chief economist at raymond james associates
710772008,of course the gop blames the president but the gop isn't passing any bills to help the citizens with the jobs or economy the gop isn't looking at the hp people they laid off and the fact may has always been a down month in jobs the summer tourist season starts in june which will increase jobs then down in sept and then back up for the snowbirds season in fact the bahamas make all their employees take their vacations in the down months may and mid sept to mid oct so we had a down month but lets look at all the up months compared to the last year of the bush presidency
710772008,as nobel prize winning economist paul krugman explained today when the private sector is frantically trying to pay down debt the public sector should do the opposite spending when the private sector can t or won t by all means let s balance our budget once the economy has recovered but not now the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity instead congress driven by a cut happy republican house has pursued austerity leading to hundreds of thousands of public sector job losses last month alone state and local level education jobs disappeared something tea bagger anti government nuts will never agree
710772008,thousands of jobs leaving for communist asian sweatshops and the republican'ts refuse to remove the incentives that bush cheney made law until we plug the leak we risk bankruptcy and the end of the americandream
710772214,government isn't helping government jobs cuts are worsening the jobs picture the federal government shed jobs in may state governments and local governments cut overall governments have cut jobs in of the past months tax collections by state and local governments have been rising since mid yet the belt tightening continues from january through march government cuts reduced u s economic growth by percent point to an annual pace of just percent typically the government offers a base level of support when the economy is weak says scott brown chief economist at raymond james associates
710772214,rep paul ryan r wis the budget committee chairman added that both parties had made mistakes in shepherding the economy in the past but declared that government needed to get out of the way and give americans more economic freedom hey ryan since government have gotten out of the way the econmy have worsen overall governments have cut jobs in of the past months tax collections by state and local governments have been rising since mid yet the belt tightening continues from january through march government cuts reduced u s economic growth by percent point to an annual pace of just percent
710772214,rep chris van hollen md the top democrat on the budget committee noted that hundreds of thousands of americans were losing their jobs in the months before former president bush left office in and said bush's policies tipped the scales toward the wealthy and wall street go chris van hollen
710772214,van hollen and pelosi two morons that make even the maniac al gore seem sane in comparison
710772214,somebody tell van hollen to look at the jobs report that's not bush's fault but this idiot would like to make it so the blame for this economic failure falls on the president aka supreme idiot and the democrates vote for mitt in november
710772214,cut government employment by they need to get real jobs and actually do something other than leech off the working man
710772214,give me trillion and years i would have done wonders obama and friends not so much

710772214,chris van hollen represents the worst of progressive professional politicians maybe with the exception of her highness the right honorable nancy pelosi they've got egg on their sorry collective faces and you can bet you bottom dollar that the vitriol and charges of racism are going to come screaming from the left like shells from a battleship it's over and the little progressive piggies are going to squeal their guts out can't wait to hear what baghdad bob jay carney has to say this afternoon that should be a real hoot so stay tuned folks this is going to get very very rich it is not inconceivable that the white house may actually be running out of lies they can share quickly enough to avoid a revolt wisconsin is going to be the death knell
710772214,whiner alert
710772214,'we're from the government and we're here to help'
710772214,when you have the facts on your side argue the facts when you have the law on your side argue the law when you have neither holler
710772214,any company with this performance would fire obama why shouldnt we

710772214,van hollen showed his partisian bs that again showed his true arrogance the election should have woke these progressives pukes up nope they will tow the obama reid and pelosi line to the end
710772214,van hollen needs to criticize his own mama for raising such a self absorbed dumba
710772214,good gosh this is getting funny how desperate are the democrats to now call on bush's family to denounce bush my goodness the liberals have run out things to talk about failure will you do that to'ya
710772214,like el len an swered i cant bel ieve that some one can pr ofit in four wee ks on the comp uter have you se en th is we bsite c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
710772214,dims are toast
710772214,mr cantor what have you and boehner done lately or ever to help america recover from bush recession zero you are gleeful that your game plan is working remember your famous meeting with ryan gingrich and others on the day of obama's inauguration to obstruct every obama administration initiative to fix the bush economy ever since you have been doing just that tank the economy refuse to cooperate with obama and then blame obama you are not coming to this debate about the economy with a clean hand buddy you surely think americans are stupid and wouldn't notice and would reward republicans nonetheless that wouldn't happen in november you can bet on it
710772214,unbelievable van hollen would be so disrespectful these idiots have to go
710772214,see chris your party really screwed up you forced hcr down our throats did you not think that you would poison the well you did
710772214,funny that by your logic republicans are responsible for the dismal democratic record on the economy by their obstruction and reluctance to let the democrat's proposals pass by this same logic then democrats are responsible for the recession you see from democrats were the majority in the house and obstructed bush's legislation and plans therefore causing the economic catastrophe not allowing government to work led us to the present and democrats are to blame with their refusal to do anything constructive democrats have never been responsible for anything why should anyone let them claim responsibilty or credit for only good things
710772214,sam i am nice tantrum what about the first two years of this administraton when the dems had a virtually insurmountable majority where has the budget been since this president took office why is the liberal progressive socialist way of compromise is to do it my way if you don't you are an obstructionist or racist i am firmly convinced that people like you would vote for charles manson if he ran as a democrat
710772214,representative van hollen if i lived in maryland i would actively campaign against your re election as a representative you represent nothing sir nothing your constituents should re call you tomorrow for your political inference instead of your best efforts to solve the economic problem you are pointing your finger stop and realize you have three pointing right back at you
710772214,the death knell is going to be when the supremes knocks out all of the health care and believe me that is in store for june oh wait we are in june the worst president ever he has set the black man back fifty years
710772214,take a look at bush vs obama
710772214,where is the data to support your statement bilko
710772214,unfortunately the democrats only wish that were the choice facing voters perhaps you may have heard that the election will feature mitt romney against obama sadly instead of engaging in critical evaluation of the president and his policies and results many want to talk about his predecessor i don't think it's an argument that interests most voters in fact it sounds a lot like finger pointing and excuse making it seems that we have seen a lot of that since president obama's inauguration
710772214,democrats in full panic mode they are fully scared they will lose it all in november and rightly so for once they might have figured it out the games' up girls you had every branch of govt for years and accomplished zero except an unconstitutional power grab of medicine that's gone soon too don't let the door hit you on the way out
710772214,shut up ahole hollen
710772214,van hollen is a congressman and responsible as much as anyone is
710772214,dr sam you need to go back to school your fantasies about republicans are the result of your first brainwashing let's try this again enroll in a conservative school and get a real education then you may comment
710772214,i'm sorry mr van hollen weren't you dillholes in control of the congress the last years of the bush administration and the first years of the illustrious pot smoker obama's administration you must be smoking a lot of weed too
710772214,the democrats can not move foreward from in fact most of their prescriptions are decades old liberal crap that never worked
710772214,maybe employers saw the socialist devastation of obama coming after he was elected and reacted by cutting people loose is that a posiibility van holland ya sure it is besides how desperate and pathetic yo van holland own it already your guy is the prezzy it's his baby obama is failing before their very eyes and these democretins reach back in time to blame bush
710772214,yo moron idiot boy you bottom feeders have been in office for years now look in the mirror your socialist marxist hope and change we screw you is working fine isn't it you all have a severe case of crainial rectumitis
710772214,no true american democrat supports obama's destruction of america let's not go down in history standing behind the most incompetant man to hold public office do not nominate him to run again take back our party from the socialists
710772214,years in and obama still won't take responsibility that in itself argues against his re election
710772214,excuse the language but van hollen is a socialist pig straight up the guy has never seen a government action tax confiscation rule regulation or statute that he didn't like he is a true believer in the healing power of government action
710772214,what did you expect from van hollen any diversion to keep scrutiny off the obama economic record
710772214,oh yea love it their record sucks so now they yap about bush relatives what's next bitching about doro's kids
710772214,jeebus these dems are soooo petty and classless
710772214,somebody please correct me if i'm wrong but it seems to me that back in the summer of the summer of recovery things were looking up debbie wasserman schultz was on t v talking about the economy and said that it was now 'obama's economy' we own it sorry but you can't be an indian giver and take that back even if you have high cheekbones like lizzy warren the democrats own this thing and it sucks
710772214,well since obama has continued the insane spending and political corruption i guess i agree with van hollen everyone needs to go and we need to start over with term limits and consequences for these washington barfbags
710772214,bwahahahaha you're an idiot dr remember what obama said in a meeting with cantor right after the election he said quote i won well obama won now he's losing and soon he'll be gone deal with it
710772214,actually the recession was caused by policies going back to the carter administration that is how we got to an over inflated housing market the community reinvestment act and civil rights legislation were used by community organizers the black caucus etc to threaten the banks with lawsuits if they did not relax their lending standards it led to sub prime loans sliced and diced bundled paper passed through fannie and freddie government enterprises which acted like banks to give these loans which did not meet standards government guarantees that put the tax payer on the barb and we got too big to fail dodds frank did not fix it but institutionalized it the democrats pretend it was someone else s fault the record shows president bush saw the danger but frank and dodds said it was time to roll the dice they did and we know the result since the democrats do not recognize the problem their policies to address it have led to stagnation and high persistent unemployment
710772214,as an independent i voted for obama but am getting a bit tired of these attacks on bush there comes a time when you own the economy not sure who i'll vote for but if the dems don't get off this bain bs it certainly won't be for obama my wife who voted for obama is so disgusted that she doesn't even want to vote for either party a bad place to be for the country
710772214,the smoking crater owe conomy continues to destroy what's left of the private sector while preezy is busy at six fundraisers today alone hopefully he can squeeze in a quick nine to alleviate the stress of his 'laser like focus' on himself
710772214,when you have neither van hollen
710772214,we have an election next week in wisconsin where walker is running on his record his party held control of the state government pushed through his reforms and they worked we have an election in november in america where obama is running away from his record his party held control of congress for two years pushed through their agenda and look where we are bring on the november tidal wave
710772214,that's right that's what he said back in the summer of ' did bush sneak in and mess things up again don't think so
710772214,yes let's learn from the past which party has the most lawyers in it i believe that's the democratic party do you like lawyers personally i hate lawyers let's show the democrats a repeat of the elections
710772214,it really is telling how liberals in general lash out when presented with opinions and facts that don't fit their worldview their rebuttals when confronted with actual facts are either personal attacks or meaningless cliches it really is telling you must realize that folks that think like that are virtually impossible to deal with it's the equivalent to arguing reason with add six year old frankly you'd have a better chance with the kid
710772214,heh heh heh i like to see the rats scurrying as the ship sinks
710772214,in when we lose the war against altair i expect bush will be the scapegoat
710772214,the dems had control of both houses of clowngress for years and all they could come up with was pending and obamacare and no budget the claim of bush's fault no longer washes and those that invoke that are shown to be buffoons
710772214,very few ever seem to figure this one out well said
710772214,well they did give the clean articulate black kid a chance the black kid failed miserably
710772214,the dog ate my homework school of political discourse won't be long now for the panicked dems to start to bail on the spectacularly incompetent obama
710772214,you and your old lady appear to be two of the idiots who put this country in this situation do us all a favor and stay the frick home in november if you are that stupid
710772214,the economy may have began falling while bush was in office but the congress was controlled by the democrats at the time and congress appropriates money and passes legislation everyone forget chris dodd and barney
710772214,the great oazzhat half plate lip kenyan half white trash dung pile is finished
710772214,ha ha don't get sick james i might be making quite a leap but even if it's a landlside as it should be i'm not betting this cretin will leave under his own steam he's nuts and drunk with power
710772214,blame everyone don't spend time fixing anything just tell each other what they should have been saying years ago landslide coming in november r in
710772214,the really tragic thing is that van hollen is a complete thug he feigns cooperation on problems and mugs for a fawning leftist press and then sticks the shiv in the republicans back just when they think the progressive shill may be sincere
710772214,these liberals are really stuck on stupid obama the incompetent has surrounded himself with advisers and staff that don't seem to have a clue as to how to fix this economy the advisers to a person is a socialist marxist it doesn't work in our country they are doubling and tripling down on failure they fail do the same thing again only to fail again their ideology and lack of practical experience is really telling collectively they could not run a hot dog cart we have to vote him out
710772214,as an economic moderate bush listened to and went along with ideas of the left all too often this was especially true after the dems ran on the theme a new direction for america in and won control of the house and senate as you may recall that is when the economy started heading in the wrong direction obama is merely trying to fundamentally transform our nation into a top down socialist state or plunder america's riches if you believe the islamic association both have the same result loss of freedoms and prosperity for americans
710772214,and here we were told obama was better than bush i guess now they're the same
710772214,what kind of dr are you dr sam
710772214,van hollen needs to remove his head from obama's rectum clean his ears out from all that democrap and listen to the citizens that are paying his salary now the liar in chief is on the tv spewing his crap and guess what i can still see van hollen's shoulders on down but not his head
710772214,what a joke still blaming bush if it wasn't so sad i'd be lmao
710772214,those charts only tell me we should not have dems in control of congress
710772214,take heart semby this is a sign of desperation nothing is more dangerous than a wounded and cornered animal hopefully these clowns will be completely out of power in november just be vigilant and keep everyone you know pumped up and ready to vote
710772214,we could really use your vote for mitt this time cant promise it but i beleive he wont do as much damage as obama especially an obama with no accountability to getting another term those czars are scary in that situation regulation after regulation
710772214,van hollen is from a state that relies on nothing but govt jobss what does he know about employment
710772214,sort of reminds me when my youngest son was caught with his hand in the cookie jar and blamed it on his older brother of course they were and at the time time we put adults back in charge in november
710772214,what a hoot he searched the record for what two minutes i bet he read the obamacare bill from page one to the very end too get off your ass and quit living in the past it doesn't matter what george did you have had three years plus to fix it if you worked for any private enterprise you would have been long gone
710772214,van hollen is brain dead have you ever seen this jackass bloviate on the news nothing but worn out talking points time for the dems to run on their record the verbal diarrhea won't work this time for the merry group of marxists pack your bags
710772214,van hollen kinda embarrassing
710772214,i wonder if people realize that after and a half years to continue to blame bush for the economy or anything else for that matter only serves to admit that obama is too incompetent to do anything three and a half years come on already furthermore for two of those years obama and his democrats had total and absolute power in government they could have done anything they wanted anything the republicans could not stop them if their lives depended on it they could have repealed the bush tax cuts for the so called rich whoever they are they could have closed gitmo they could have ended the wars in iraq and afghanistan they could have done anything but what did they do they have spent the last and a half years blaming bush for their own incompetence
710772214,well bush did visit the white house yesterday so obviously the jobs report is due to his presence there
710772214,doctor of idiocy
710772214,blame gwb it's all they've got nobama no more novebmer
710772214,ok seriously what type of drug s is this guy van hollen on the trouble has always been at least since carter was president that the democrats know things only spend like mad and when that doesn't work play the blame game or throw the racial card i am sick of them democrat free in
710772214,years in and they're still blaming bush i guess it'll be his fault too when obama loses in a landslide in november
710772214,fix the blame don't fix the problem the democratic election slogan for
710772214,bush at least believed in the constitution does obama
710772214,don't blame me blame what a tool
710772214,distraction whatever bush did or didn't do years ago was years ago candidate obama promised policies that would lead to change he has not delivered on his promise bosses fire employees that don't deliver we the bosses of the united states of america to president obama you're fired
710772214,' van hollen is just like about every democrat i know they blame bush and his 'policies' for all the problems even thought they never warned of any of this and can't name any policies besides the tax cuts for the rich bumper sticker pretty sad actually
710772214,i call bull the first chart shows that the bush era tax cuts to be the main cause of our deficit troubles strange that those were passed early in bush's first term yet in jan six years into the bush administration the annual deficit was what is today as for the second chart and third chart we can go back to the jan date and note that the unemployment rate was so if jobs had been lost at that point as your charts suggest why was the unemployment rate just of half of what it is today sorry but your cute little charts are not backed by reality finally why did i pick jan that's the month that democrats took over congress see things were going great up until that point by any standard remember congress writes the laws all the president can do is sign or veto them the only blame bush gets after is for signing instead of vetoing before that r's held congress bush is an r so he led policy obama is a d for the first half of obama's term both houses of congress were controlled by d's giving obama full blame just as bush gets credit for his first six years the blame doesn't belong to bush look to pelosi reid
710772214,what van holland failed to realize is that his party the democrats controlled both houses of congress during the final two years of the bush administration amazingly that is when things started to go south of course dems don't take responsibility for that did van holland also mention that gas prices were half of what they are now when bush was in office time for these people to go
710772214,silly little republicans dear leader has yet to unleash the occupy brownshirts and al sharpton's pavement apes race riots and a war with iran will ensure that dear leader remains in power then all counter revolutionaries and racists who opposed dear leader must be purged from our utopian society
710772214,boehner was right tarp was indeed a crap sandwich and obama's stimulus opposed by every republican and dodd frank opposed by nearly every republican passed anyway with the dems super majorities yet did nothing to lift the economy as i see it the republicans were right in their opposition
710772214,the poor employment numbers couldn't have come at a better time to reinforce the fact that this president does not want a successful economy people won't need him and his government handouts if they can do for themselves between now and october there will be pressure from the left to 'fudge' some more numbers amazing that the numbers for the past several months had to be revised downward to accurately reflect what's truly going on in the economy there are trillion dollars waiting to be invested but no one trusts the dems
710772214,hey van hollen no budget out of congress in three years who are you to say anything to anyone about diddling the pooch kiss my stern tube sport you are just another big mouth that is part of the problem in this country it is bed wetters like you that have gotten us into the mess we are in so just belt up and get back to passing a budget which is your constitutional duty
710772214,van hollen and his colleagues in the demacratic party had controll for most of bush's term they are the ones that let this happen
710772214,well said and love it pounce full panic mode
710772214,the markets crashed and the economy dried up on the anticipation of electing our first socialist president who was running around promising to bankrupt the coal industry impose a value added tax on all energy consumption and double the capital gains taxes out of 'fairness' since then he's spent in deficits every single year over the earlier trend line and also blew the almost in tarp repayments from the banks that was earmarked to reduce the national debt baby blame is like bush's out of control teenage child blaming all of his failures on daddy me though i simply would like a little return better than treading water for the in additional deficits yes almost per family in this country that obama charged up over the last three and a half years for our grandchildren to pay
710772214,not sure who you'll vote for your wife will stat home rather than vote i totally agree with cordite's assessment
710772214,i expect more and more political dirty tricks as the obama democrat desperation grows for the sake of our american future we must hope that the majority of voting americans will see through all the smoke screens in november
710772214,this is going to be a fun five months watching the democrats operating in full panic blaming everyone and accepting no responsibility did i hear david axelrod saying yesterday fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me while telling voters to reelect obama
710772214,reality always trumps utopia these people are absolutely clueless
710772214,the true trademarks of an adolescent are the inability to tell the difference between responsibility and accountability and a tiresome knee jerk pointing the finger of blame at others for his own shortcomings obama is and has always been an oh so cool eddie haskell wannabe in basketball shorts he's surrounds himself with a pack of protective drooling sycophants who hang on his every word and keep telling him he's pretty apathetically enabled peter pan obama's never had to grow up and address his failings like an adult like a man underneath all the tough talk and all the disjointed bluster he's the punchline to a not so funny joke and sadly way down deep he knows it november can't come soon enough
710772214,do o'bama and his crew not realize how foolish and impotent it makes them look to blame everything bad on george w bush if o'bama can't accept at least some of the responsibility after years then why would anyone want to re elect him really why
710772214,so which party controlled the house and senate in van hollen has a very slective memory
710772214,center for american progress obumbler supporter figuers never lie but liers always figure
710772214,let's work to make sure that romney wins states in november and let obama have those other
710772214,why would you want the new tea party repubs to go they are the only ones standing up for fiscal responsibility they are the ones who pimaried the rinos let's just get rid of all the big spenders dems and repubs
710772214,the big jobs losses started after obama was elected the writing was already on the wall lets hope this demorat hack gets the boot
710772214,it's palpable democrats all of a sudden can see everything crashing down and they will commence their slash and burn campaign and smear anyone in their way think of a baby having his bottle taken i dont think the electorate is going to buy it this year
710772214,this epic fail brought to you by delusional democrats r us rather amusing in a pathetic sort of way
710772214,chrissy van hollen is an bama throne sniffer and bathwater drinker he was part of the problem when his party controlled the purse strings during the previous administration partnering with the liberal media playing the blame game and using the race card are all these charlatan libbies have left hurt these folks but will be devastating for them
710772214,democrats the party of know nothing lying clowns
710772214,the economy began to sink the moment the democrats took control of congress bush was a lame duck at the time his power and influence on the decline jobs and wealth increase when there are good prospects on the horizon but how could an anti business anti liberty marxist lunatic with an empty resume and a hidden past inspire any confidence in people two years before obama became president the writing was on the wall america was going to be in deep doo doo and the best thing to do would be to hunker down save your money and hope that the storm doesn't rob you of everything the blame for this financial crisis is all on obama's shoulders it was his plan from the beginning
710772214,or even better that darn george washington for starting this whole mess
710772214,a sitting president has to run on his record that is what the people are going to judge him on losing track of that is nothing but panic
710772214,grow up and man up for heavens sake your year gravy train ride at taxpayer expense is over you have bankrupted this nation and now must face the reckoning
710772214,ok kiddos let's review the current downturn is due to the burst of the housing bubble the housing bubble was constructed over decades by congressional dems trying to expand home ownership by down trodden minorities regardless of intentions those mortgages for folks who couldn't afford payments was a bad idea it is not amusing to hear the dems who caused the bubble blaming gwbush and everyone other than themselves mainly led by barney frank and chris dodd peternacl
710772214,d'ohbama needs to man up and own this economy his constant whining is becoming truly annoying the buck stops at your desk barry
710772214,what is there to criticize bush about the community reinvestment act was passed by andrew cuomo as hud director under clinton the housing bubble was driven by the democrats when the gop wanted stronger regulations to suppress it barney frank saw nothing wrong with fannie and freddie obama and chris dodd were two of the highest compensated senators that benefited from lobbying for the housing bubble the democrats had a supermajority and total control of congress from to four years two years before the economic collapse not to mention that none of the gop supported the failed stimulus three years without a budget passed two under a supermajority this is mostly if not all the democrats fault and yet zero accountability from the left for their epic record of failure
710772214,maybe just maybe obama and the senate blocking and ignoring the bills passed by the house aimed at improving the private sector economy has not worked out so well i am just saying
710772214,not only did republicans oppose the stimulus package the first vote had zero republican votes in favor dnc is in a full blown panic mode short of running hillary in obama's place this election is over
710772214,chris van hollen is a dnc lap dog who hails from the land of we haven't seen a tax we don't like also known as maryland he is an idiot
710772214,hey van holland we were critisizing the right guy back the abarny frank and his fannie freddie fiasco's demanding no red lining and sub prime lending
710772214,people voted for hope and change the got change the situation on the other hand is looking less hopeful every day even with the fed gov playing games with a lot of the real numbers business people are bluntly saying the wh is anti business when you hire a new coach and give him years to get the team in shape and almost four years latter things aren't any better nothing you can say about the previous coach is going to matter george bush isn't running for president romney is running for president and he says his priority is the economy and he does have a track record that suggests he know how to get the economy going
710772214,will obama ever man up and take responsibility for making bad decisions and worrying more about taking care of his donors than the american people this is going to be the most important election in our lifetimes anybody but obama
710772214,make masturbating a full time job with benefits
710772214,and as it turns out the worst economic recession since the great depression that obama keeps talking about officially ending in june of before stimulus was fully implemented circular firing squad coming right up now us non democrats need to continually remind the american people what happens when democrats are given any amount of responsibility or power if we succeed at that america will always be prosperous and the american people will always remain free
710772214,say van hollen start walking east and don't stop
710772214,dr sam as a voting republican i can assure you we wanted nothing more than for our representatives to fight against the socialistic tendencies of this president by whatever means necessary
710772214,let's face it nobody will invest in america again until obama's gone
710772214,lol like democrats are the vanguard of fiscal sanity and restraint lawlz nice try van hollen so let's put that in the petri dish and see what happened when you had both houses of congress and the presidency well lookie here you spent like druken sailors with your hair on fire in a barn of gasoline not only a liar but an idiot as well the public is on to you guys we see the final death throes of economies across the pond that follow socialist ideology it has historically failed and will fail here if allowed to continue but not before it bankrupts us laying us wide open for the vultures of the world not on our watch buddy
710772214,ike the dems were in control of congress after the mid terms the republicans only gained control of the house after the election
710772214,absolutely correct
710772214,the only buck that stops at barry's desk are the ones from the chooma gang
710772214,wtf are these democrats smoking that legal incense stuff
710772214,this is why democrats support obamacare they need a lot of psychatric care
710772214,someone should tell rep van hollen that highest non farm payroll in us history was in then of course the democratic party assumed the majority in the us house and senate the rest is history
710772214,if you just read and follow what van hollen says you have to conclude that he is a delusional idiot and unfortunately the entire state of md is that way too
710772214,you mean barney fwank
710772214,i guess that the panic set in as soon as obama got elected i expect the hiring to start back up again in november after obama gets defeated
710772214,ok i will succumb it is bush's fault and the fault of the gop but wait there's more the democrats have had years to correct it and have been unsuccessful how's that hope and change working for you now time to collect unemployment and get out of the way
710772214,how long before it's obama's fault look at the bright side at least they're done blaming lincoln
710772214,what you should really compare is who held congress since they pass the tax laws and budgets what you will find is democrats were in charge of both houses from and the bush tax cuts ended in they are now the obama tax cuts dec the democrat senate vote in favor of passing senate amendment dec the democrats house of representatives approved dec president obama signed the bill
710772214,the wheels are coming off can't wait til november
710772214,tarp granted treasury unprecedented power with no congressional oversight dodd frank bestowed sole authority to tax audit fine and subpoena banking institutions to the fed reserve board any republican who voted against these atrocities should be praised
710772214,i thought there are term limits for the office of the president of the united states how in the world has george w bush been able to win a rd term o i see zero is still blaming w
710772214,the dems are responible for this disaster or depression
710772214,i do not think the voters are going to blame bush
710772214,obama blame someone else no he would never he prefers to vote present
710772214,in fact manufacturing jobs have been leaving the country starting way back in after the metal workers strike when american companies wised up to the fact that they could be held hostage to unionized suppliers in the u s so they spread their eggs out in other baskets to ensure uninterrupted supply and therefore survivability when you hold industries hostage don't be surprised when they give someone else your jobs
710772214,you present a steaming pile of liberal crap and expect anyone to buy it center for american progress you must be insane or my guess is stupid rent a conservative brain for a day or find something constructive to do
710772214,big government unresponsive to common sense solutions and all are suffering as the result common sense is all too uncommon voltaire
710772214,they soon will start using ballistics for their attacks
710772214,the first tarp vote had zero republican votes also but nancy pelosi and the media threatened the repubs would be responsible for the second great depression if they did not change their vote bush caved to pelosi and mod repubs cave to the media
710772214,von hollen you are another weiner floating down the river like a flea yelling raise the draw bridge von hollen look at the reid obama pelosi hoyer von hollen energy bill passed in that has finished destroying the economy that was left after dodd frank schumer obama raines rahm emmanuel had destroyed the housing banking freddie fannie fiasco and we are still pumping money into their whoard nov can not come one day to soon when a new day begins in america god bless america as we trek back to america the great we once knew
710772214,blame everyone but the man in charge who brought the economy back from the brink supposedly hey clueless you ever think jobs were getting dumped in late because the writing was on the wall that the socialist idiot was going to win
710772214,of course the liberals took congress in and the economy tanked in but the don't want to talk about that
710772214,apparently they never heard of the community reinvestment act which caused this whole economic debacle a democrat barney frank pet project
710772214,obama's economic policies were likely hatched over a bottle of vodka with teddy kennedy vladimir putin brack obama bill clinton and nancy pelosi each sucking up black sea caviar one policy was discussed how to bring the united states to its knees as payback for the fall of the russian block nations multiple tools used some being fannie mae and freddi mac
710772214,they had congress since don't forget
710772214,get a life van hollen and take a long look at who's been president for years you want the credit you take the blame
710772214,take a hke goinfantry you a doppa von hollen you are another weiner floating down the river like a flea yelling raise the draw bridge von hollen look at the reid obama pelosi hoyer von hollen energy bill passed in that has finished destroying the economy that was left after dodd frank schumer obama raines rahm emmanuel had destroyed the housing banking freddie fannie fiasco and we are still pumping money into their whoard nov can not come one day to soon when a new day begins in america god bless america as we trek back to america the great we once knew
710772214,it's not obama's fault for as long as the big media folks allow him to blame bush media has invested a lot into this guy so they do not want to loose face they still weild a lot of power so they will not give in easily
710772214,from your lips to god's ear you know i have lost two primary care physicians to the affordable heathcare act one went to work in a clinic for army families a hour per day commute for her but a steady check wwith no malpractice and no gov headaches and the other older physician through in the towel emr has made all of my aged mother in law's medical records so difficult to obtain that i actually ask for paper copies to take from one doc to the next at their request because they can't pull them out of the cloud reliably to be clear these are substantial practices associated with the best names in nc what a cluster and only getting worse and more expensive
710772214,dems have had control since almost years after the famous pelosi speech we will drain the swamp
710772214,don't you remember tom hanks said in his adoration film about obama that obama doesn't blame anybody but takes charge opps more liberal lies
710772214,win the future with that fool what the fandango
710772214,more democrat desperation this time from chris wassweman van hollen yawn zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
710772214,government employees produce nothing but are paid to spend tax dollars earned by those who work for a living obama's huge stimulus should have been dollars sent back to tax payers who best can stimulate the economy it was a big mistake the way it was done anybody want to argue
710772214,can any dumbocrat go one day without using the name bush how about manning up and taking responsibility for your regime's failures my god how long are you going to blame bush it's been and gd years
710772214,the buck stops here harry truman i didn't do it bart simpson and obama
710772214,blame it on bush again and again and again and again and again and again i don't think bush spent trillions in taxpayer dollors for a stimulus that was nothing but an enormous pork barrel aimed at his friends and donors it seems to me that bush's tarp was in the form of loans that have been largely paid back that is something o tries to take credit for by the way o's stimulus was an enormous treasury raid in behalf of his very wealthy friends remember that o has lots of money and lots of very wealthy friends when you are pointing the finger at the other guy
710772214,mr obama probably wont get re elected lol at those who think electing willard will help willard can't make europe get it's act together or do anything about the slow down in growth in china the dems in congress can obstruct willard the same way the republicans did to mr obama turn around is fair play
710772214,obama is in a no way situation admit that he made some mistakes with creating jobs may buy him some sympathy votes but his mistakes are so epic and inexcuseable it will kill his hopes for reelection that is why they continue to blame bush for everything i just hope joe america is smart enough to see through this don't people remember the election of they tossed the republicans out and took over the last two years of the bush admin were actually the first two of obama's in reality am i saying that bush was perfect no but i think people are really missing him about now
710772214,how about the unconstitutional and illegal power grab of the auto industry in behalf of the unions
710772214,this is actually quite funny that some knuckleheaded congressman can make such a proclamation is symbolic of a kind of surrealistic denial you see in kafka's metamorphosis i mean you have to laugh
710772214,nothing will change for the better as long as oblome is in office down with obozo
710772214,certainly nothing to brag about at any rate complete failure
710772214,control of the house is not control of congress can't blame the republicans for too much of this mess as even today 's of the ruling class are democrats how many jobs bills have been sent to the senate and stonewalled by reid
710772214,so last month when unemployment went down it was still bush's fault i fail to see the logic
710772214,typical demorats always some elses fault now that they're in charge and this have gotten worse it's bush's fault do they not remember it was bush who tried to prevent the fannie mae and freddie mac train wreck only to have the demorat lead finance committee tell everyone that everything was fine the the bubble bursts because of their policies which started the snowball going down hill no of course they don't bring that up bottom line it was the demorats who ruined our economy bush's unemployment rate was never higher than idiot liars on the left when we the people vote in november we'll have the senate back and more seats in the house and romney as president this four year nightmare will soon be over the adults will be back in power
710772214,obama has had years and months to affect the economy positively he has not homeowners continue to lose their equity either in foreclosure or degraded property values people continue to lose their jobs due to business closure or downsizing and the unemployed continue to be under counted due to ssdi early s s claims and non participation in applying for work by those previously collecting unemployment taking a substantial portion of the unemployed off the bls rolls the actual unemployment is in the order of obama is an unmitigated disaster
710772214,except you conveniently miss the point that the crash caused by the housing bubble was directly related to the government democrat policy forcing banks to give bad loans to people that couldn't afford them in the interest of fairness we shouldn't discriminate on color but when you loan money you need to discriminate on ability to pay or you go out of business the family you loaned the money to loses their house and the economy suffers and more people lose their jobs it's a loser every time in fact the bush administration wanted to audit fannie and freddie and reign in these loans but were rebuffed by wait for it democrats what the banks did in repackaging these loans into different financial objects was an attempt to mitigate their risk you know the risk you were forced to take by the federal goverment to provide bad loans that was a symptom not the problem the problem is you need to tell people the truth when they don't need to be home owners until they get their financial house in order otherwise you do them and all of us great harm
710772214,we all know that they government fiddled with the numbers by taking out those who are no longer on unemployment or are employed part time or have given up out of the figures look at today's report one can prove anything they desire with graphs and numbers the true numbers tell a different story
710772214,how strangely selective your choice of data how about we look at the change from the height of private sector employment million in june to the time obama was inaugurated we'll call it jan though since it was the th realistically feb would be more accurate million a loss of million private sector jobs in the last years of the bush presidency as of dec as you point out there were million private sector jobs an increase admittedly meager of million jobs and those jobs have continued to increase albeit all too slowly now you can argue about why jobs haven't grown faster under obama but at least they have as opposed to the wholesale job destruction committed by bush so as far as drinking kool aid goes you might want to put down the pitcher and back away
710772214,truly sad that the leader of the free world would continue to admit that he does not have the skill or intelligence to change what his predecessor did has there ever been any president who refused to take ownership for the state of the union after years
710772214,how about taft i blame him or maybe coolidge it was one of those bastards i'm sure of it
710772214,well they did force government motors and obamacare on us
710772214,van hollen take a tip from jim webb keep your head down and see if there is anything useful for your political career in the obamian rubble post bad career move to bail o's canoe
710772214,why don't they show the graph throughout the years of the busch presedency you only show the graph of the last year of bush's eight years in office it's interesting that when the dems took back both the senate and the house is when things begin turn south
710772214,obozo used the stimulus for his own benefit to pay off his donors and unions it had nothing to do with the american people and there needs he is a complete liberal commie joke
710772214,racist much
710772214,if the democrats can not correct the economic problem after three years and all they have to offer is to blame bush why would anyone in their right mind vote for obama again in seven years will he still be blaming bush it is time to give someone else a chance and that man is mitt romney ps to democrat leader chris van hollen why dont you call barbara bush i am sure she would have a few choice words for you personally i think you make a very strong case to dump obama he failed even with having the entire congress for the first two years of his administration
710772214,both parties are the same just the two wings of the same dragon terrorizing the u s republicans support crony capitalism by pushing to give large businesses huge tax cuts or evade taxes altogether and call it the 'trickle down' effect while those huge companies outsource jobs and then donate money to the party of the month democrats support them via 'stimulus packages' like solyndra and then the companies donate large sums of that money back to the politicians on both sides of the isle it amounts to our tax money being stolen and given away only so that a lot of it is returned to the thieves at the end of the day and all the way they trample our rights and freedoms the patiot act under a rep admin and the dhs and tsa going bonkers under a dem admin nobody ever opposes the war on drugs which manifests a violent black market that the feds waste so much of our money failing to stop yeat after year all that matters is that we get the dangerous high people out of their basements and into prison and then spend even more money taking care of them there it's just such a circus libertarian or gtfo ron paul will still be on the ballot just so ya'll know
710772214,if you want to see the jobs picture and the stock market really go into the tank watch what will happen if the senate with harry reid actually even proposed the budget they really want
710772214,van hollen is one slimy little weasel why don't you blame it on george washington he started it all remember when the biggest job loss occurred when bush was in office nov dec jan the three months following the election of obama it was business starting its contraction triggered by the obama election had mccain won those losses would not have happened the beauty of that claim is it makes the most sense and you lefties can't prove it's wrong the biggest legacy of the obama administration is that democrats are poison to a strong economy the people will not forget this remember that the economy started having trouble when the democrats took over congress after the midterm elections when peloci and reid took over and started the great reckless spending binge
710772214,in the private sector if my boss came to me and said how come sales are down for the entire time you have been working here and i said 'it's the guy's fault who worked here before me don't you think i would be showed the door just a thought
710772214,gdp gross domestic product
710772214,they would blame moses if they could
710772214,half of the dems will become independents and the other half will split their time between kooky hoaxes global warming war on women non i d voters gluten free suppositories and looking for a police car to defecate on good bye numbskulls we won't miss you
710772214,not if they lose the senate and more of the house let us wait and see shall we ps i hit the like button by accident
710772214,it's meltdown time for dems yesterday it was axlerod quoting jack nicholson that you the boston protesters can't handle the truth when he was heckled clinton's in wisconsin to campaign for tom barrett and endorses romney the state controlled media is perplexed that even the cooked unemployment figures the regime floats out are awful prominent black dems praise romney while distancing themselves from obummer artur davis quits the democrat party while crticizing dear leader pelosi even claims to know the constitution the whole democrat plantation seems on the verge of mutiny and obummer turns his lackeys loose to do his dirty work like this idiot van hollen on a bush blaming tirade while he goes to fundraisers the world financial market implosion is being accelerated by the the failures of the regime to turn the economy around the regime declared the recession was over in june finally catching up with them and all they can do is continue to blame bush it's more than months until jan assuming this clown and his fellow travelers are booted out in november will there be enough left of this country to try to save a lot of damage can still be done by a spiteful and vindictive sore loser manchild and his underlings by then
710772214,funny job layoffs began right after barry sotero was elected hey van hollen this economy wears a dog caller with a tag that reads if lost contact president obama white house full ownership stop blaming bush you are embarassing yourself
710772214,if someone is doing something stupid like stealing all your money taxpayer money then you should actively oppose it when you take tax payer money to bail out firms and prop up other ones then it too should be opposed we don't need compromise with programs and policies that don't work we need to stand firm on real tax reform social services reform and spending cuts not theoretical cuts or cuts in future increases in more spending but actual adult in the room cuts step back and let the adults do the heavy lifting
710772214,hmmm bush's policies the only thing that bush did wrong was sign all the bills that were passed by the democrap house and senate
710772214,how about the dems pledge to have an 'owner ship society' everybody who wants a house should have one they did and they couldn't afford them when fm and fanny may were prevented from being investigated by bush people by barney franks the selling of shares of these rotton dem mortgages continued by wall street who didn't bother to check the financial worthiness of them and sold them around the world that's your basis for where we are now this happened for years under several presidents of both parties who do you want to blame how quickly politicians forget the genesis of their folly and want to blames others when the 'others' is them
710772214,exactly how many years have to pass before someone should realize that perhaps the failed liberal policies of this administration are the problem liberalism has never worked in the past why did we think it would work this time see california detroit illinois greece europe
710772214,gee thanks
710772214,i agree that is the biggest problem with the republicans no spine why is it that back when we had an evenly divided congress a bipartisan compromise meant the dim o crits got of things their way
710772214,uhmmmm i don't know what local and state government income collections have been rising where you live but nationwise at every level they have been decreasing that's why they are upping millage rates service rates etc to try and fill in the gap businesses aren't hiring jobs are drying up and therefore tax revenue to local governments is dropping like a hot rock we have socialists that have no clue how to run a business and that are actively opposed to capatilistic endeavor and profit the real reason gdp is down is that the government credit card is maxed and they keep asking for more it's like in your personal finance if you run up debt it lowers the amount of capital you have to put toward other things feds answer hey let's print more money cutting all of our purchasing power as individuals and slashing the value of our savings all to hide the true problem federal debt levels it's not that hard to figure out once you finally understand that socialism fails high levels of government debt fail stop spending and actually make real cuts stop being antagonistic to business and get out of their way stop rewarding failure through a broken tax code and social services if the economy gets better all boats rise including tax revenues please get someone in the white house and in the senate that understands economics and basic fiscal restraint
710772214,right on sharon they spit in the face illegally of the law when they screwed secured creditors and in the trust in the legal system and capital markets it was a true brown shirt communist takeover and contrary to popular belief they still haven't paid the money back with their own profits just with other government loans i e our money obama didn't save the auto industry he saved his fund raisers the unions the auto industry would have declared bankruptcy not always a bad thing restructured and come out leaner meaner and stronger
710772214,spot on
710772214,ok disfunctional let's look at additional numbers jan million empoyed june pre recession million gain of million to that point jan million employed loss from june of million due to recession december million gain of million in years that doesn't come close to covering population growth that's million jobs created i know that this is pretty fancy cipherin' but bho's numbers stink and are not improving
710772214,dems all of you commie bastids gtfo and take mooshell and buckwheat with you
710772214,they should be what was the unemployment rate under bush vs that under obama can we remember that bush inherited a crash in the nasdaq s and p and dow from clinton and the dow ended up making new highs after the leadership shown in regardless the dems should be terrified as now if the republicans get control there is a mandate to fearlessly undo all of obamanomics and basically repeal all of the obama policies and frankly if they do i think things will get better what we are talking about is a year reversal of liberalism which i think jumped the shark this week with the bloomberg soda debacle
710772214,van hollen is indeed losing it rand paul didn't campaign against his father why expect bush to criticize bush get a clue chris it's called family ties they may disagree but they aren't going to pillory family
710772214,isn't it nice to see the far leftists like van hollen already getting desperate bush hasn't been around for years and yet all these shills can say is it's bush's fault of course when you have the gutless wonder for president i guess they have to try to shift the focus to others november th cannot get here soon enough when we can all tell obama and his money sucking wife and administration to take a hike and take their greedy hands off of our money and country
710772214,dear libtards the dim o crits have held the senate since ' they have held the white house since ' they held the house from ' through ' they had two years of a super majority in congress while holding the white house all during that time the mindless sheep of the left have been programmed to bleat baaaah baaaah blame bush blame bush baaaah baaaaah question in the liberal er for lack of a better term mind when do the dim o crits start to be held responsible for their actions
710772214,you're gonna' need to go back farther than president carter
710772214,the dems have had their way since with the majorities in both houses they have spent trillion dollars on union jobs and pet projects including obamacare and have nothing to show for their wasteful spending the economy and employment are in the crapper yet they have the gaul to still blame bush they will all be voted out in the next couple of voting cycles and they will have a very hard time coming back to power they've shown what they are made of and the country sees they are all just a large pile of cow dung clean house in november
710772214,the proper title for this article should be unimportant house minority member chris van hollen vents frustration while attempting to tarnish someone who might or might not be on the vp list while being unsure of who exactly to attack
710772214,the democrats have run this country and big cities into the bankruptcy they spend more than they take in and then they say we need more money so we can spend more and do more good net result bankruptcy and debt for our grandchildren and beyond to pay
710772214,notice that commissar van hollen doesn't mention the bush unemployment and gdp numbers probably because for most of the decade they were much better than obama's present numbers
710772214,who is this guy some kind of clown maybe he didn't notice that happen and the economy tank it took a long time and a lot of patience for bush to get the economy going but it was booming until the dems took over in and then put their fannie mac and fannie mae programs in effect to give loans to anybody that had a name even those with no jobs just a welfare check and food stamp that is what brought about the great recession and obama is still playing games with the economy and jobs
710772214,yes americans were being laid off the next day after hearing obama was elected we wouldn't be where we are today had mccain been elected just on the premise we didn't have an anti capitalist in the wh that's right getting obama elected is what deteriorated this economy to what it is today a piece of crap and this man child doesn't have a clue on how to fix it the business world also has no faith in obama hence our downfall
710772214,i would like you to show me the article and clause of the constitution that outlawed the bailout
710772214,how did van hollen get elected to anything with his lack of intelligence
710772214,he doesn't want to fix it his direction of the destruction of the us economy is deliberate he is only doing his masters' bidding is it merely coincidental that today when months of phony jobs numbers lies are finally exposed by the state controlled media and the stock market suffers it's worst day in months the bilderbergers are meeting in chantilly va just outside dc
710772214,van hollen must be behind in the polls too
710772214,last i checked his brother wasn't in office last i checked his brother isn't running for office last i heard jeb is not running for office this was a pitiful attack on someone unconnected with the poor job figures of today
710772214,well put and ever notice how the left wingers never say anything about obama extending thebush tax cuts
710772214,vanhollen and the democrats get more insane by the day bush is not the president please vote these bums out
710772214,if it weren't for all the union wall street special interests groups etc taking up the president's time by requiring his presence at all these campaign dinners and speeches the poor man might be able to perform as a real president instead whenever he gets a break from crowing about his personal awesomeness he spends his time blaming anything and everything on the bush family poor mr obama he thought it was going to be trips parties and golf whodah thought that it might mean taking responsibility for a job you campaigned for and claimed that no one else was worthy of or capable of holding last time i looked obama was the commander in chief wasn't he the one who said too bad i won boo hoo make your people proud mr obama and stand up and be a man who takes responsibility for all of his decisions and stop whining about the other guys
710772214,the democrats will never take responsibility for the poor economy its w's fault however this mantra is going to eventually backfire on all of them three years into his presidency and the dems are still yelling its w who put them in this position van hollen is a brainless twit who should keep his big mouth shut because he looks absolutely stupid now
710772214,the s t hit the fan so to speak what you are seeing are all the democrats scattering away from the messiah because they are all in trouble now there leader is going down and anyone associated with him is in for some bad karma if they want to be re elected to congress agreeing with o bama boy is detremental to their aspirations
710772214,head democrat on the budget committee that means van hollen bears great responsibility for the bleak horrific state of our current budget jeb also shows what the problem is with the establishment gop when they are faced with the snarling attack dogs of the left talk about having been coddled in a bubble yeesh
710772214,and nationalized student loans so obama can forgive them as a special gift to the next generation before the election
710772214,its called the blame game the democrats have lost all sense of reality and their leader is leading them to the promised land where that is is anyone's guess what will the dems do if they don't have w to put all their angst on unfortunately at this time the bush name brand is not in the best light and jeb would really not have a chance for higher office however give him a few good yrs away from politics and i feel jeb will come on strong maybe for a vp or even presidential position then hopefully the name will not be stigmatized anymore
710772214,i agree hopefully those in maryland will see this clown for what he is a loser
710772214,that's anyone's guess i guess intelligence is not his strongest point it must not run in his family
710772214,hey wayne the constitution is only what the federal government can do not a list of things it cannot so better break out your copy and tell us all where it says the government is allowed to take our taxes and artificially prop up failed failing businesses the gig's up progressive socialist ideology is out while exceptional american conservatism is on the way in
710772214,they would quit yelling about it as soon as the republicans quit pushing those same failed bush policies they didn't work then why do they think it will work now
710772214,no we won't vote for public betrayal by the republicans they have blocked three jobs bill and ate sitting on the transportation bill people know what is going on
710772214,i say kill keystone pipeline just to be as spiteful as republicans block tax breaks for rich and anything related to oil two can play at that game consumers got a gift in lower gas prices we can wait it out
710772214,van hollen is an ass
710772214,people are voting with their feet maryland suffered the second largest flight of residents from their state number one new york and what do maryland and new york have in common
710772214,van hollen reminds me of john edwards
710772214,i would like to say this it was a republican president and a democratic congress when the economy went down the congress controls the money and make many of the rules another thing economies are cyclic and through years the economy has ups and downs quite often during good times people get sloppy and take things for granted the economy was doing well until the democrats took over the congress as a matter of fact it was the government controlled banks that went down first since clinton these banks had been controlled by democrats even with a republican president and at one time a republican congress they were still controlled by democrats they are still controlled by democrats they failed first barney franks told the president that they were all right it was a democratic congress that did tarp the president was told that he had to act so he did act on the advice of people around him and the democratic congresst later when he saw that tarp was not working as the democratic congress said it would he had only sent out of the funds when those that were bailed out gave out bonus he did not allocate the rest of the funds it left it up to obama obama gave out the rest of the tarp to banks and again it was used for bonus he decided that we needed more out there so there were two stimilus and they did not work unemployment went up stock market went down things were worse and the debt went up why do you think that hte democrats lost in obama failed in many ways another thing as bad as belittled president bush he has kept many of his policies because the ones that he put in place has failed we are still in trouble the debt that we are in will not be paid back during my life time or my children's life time
710772214,is his middle name dick vote these incomptents out why delay all these miscreants do is run for the next office they do nothing while they're in office like obama moved up and nobody knew why or how vote these idiots out vote
710772214,once again our fearless foolish democrats in office cannot stand to take responsiblity for the current mess that they have created excessive interference in the rule of law excessive regulation excessive give aways spending huge sums of money we do not have and basically creating an economic enviroment very dilitory to buisness job creators november cannot come soon enough
710772214,i thank god daily for the genius of our founders to have implemented a balance of power that works until some wise guy thinks he can usurp their equal authority by issuing his commandments eg exec orders
710772214,not only that but he's such a productive lapdog he's in charge of getting others elected as the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee aka the democratic party r d department
710772214,be honest the job losses started when obama was elected every big business knew that taxes and regulations would hurt their bottom line and the poisonous aca would too so honestly lets keep it in perspective the de ocrat party cobbled together a perverse bill a d forced it through the congress that bill aca has already done more damage than the two wars combined when the fed has spent o er of revenue on social programs in the past ten years can you say reparations to descendants of slaves over three trillion in assistance to lower income peoples regardless of race just since the sixties some people need help to be sure but sucking on the government teat for three generations has destroyed over of black inner city families and made fathers irresponsible of their duty how pathetic the democratic processes have become in america we walk to our doom if nothing is changed in our government
710772214,it is noteworthy that in addition to van hollen debbie wasserman schultz chairperson of the democratic national committee went out of their way in an attempt to diminish jeb bush could it be the democratic party knows jeb bush will be the republican vice presidential nominee bearing in mind that jeb bush with his experience knowledge proven vote getter alliances and future potential would add enormously to the republican nationl ticket i find it most interesting
710788008,fashion powerhouse from the looks of what she's wearing i always thought fashion was supposed to be a statement not a question
710788008,one lucky peasant can dine with the aristocrats how dr le
710788008,yawn however i'd love to go have dinner with george w bush
710788008,she is so representative of middle america i can really relate to her
710788008,this is the same anna wintour whose vogue fawningly profiled syria's asma al assad as the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies just a year ago oooops vogue has removed the assad profile from its website enough said
710788008,seems someone needs to let the occupiers know what time to attend
710788008,and romney is the elitist
710788008,not that there's anything wrong with that
710788008,this is hideous on every level not least of which the face of fashion after several decades of high maintenance the shriveled puss appears to be a structural imbalance an empty head collapsing on itself
710788008,well i like mick even if his accent is atrocious
710811692,only from the 'mind' of an affirmative action disbarred america hating buffoon
710811692,can't construct a full sentence maybe you need affirmative action too
710811692,stupid ni gg er
710811692,porch mon key
710811692,two amazing women low life lying liberals
710811692,and how did obozo get a s s number from connecticut while never living there and why did he spend all that money trying to hide his birth certificate and why are his college records all sealed up why does obozo and moochelle have all these secrets
710811692,it's a sad thing that hard assed conservatives in the us aren't interested in what the world thinks about the us because the world is laughing about all those attempts at demonizing same sex couples and gay people barrack and michele obama are bright examples of a better america the world likes them for that
710811692,sorry cow you your equally vile partner and your daughters are not the standard bearers for what is right
710811692,i find it singularly unsettling that anytime anything even remotely sexual is discussed by these two they bring their two children into the discussion it has been from him commenting on his stand on killing babies he'd want his grandbaby destroyed rather than his daughter accept responsibility to fluke's sex needs to gay sex most caring parents try to protect their kids until they are old enough and have had enough experience to process information quite frankly i find it disconcerting and creepy
710811692,not surprising the first weightlfter supports lesbian matrimony if she hadn't found a girly man herself to marry she'd be wearing flannel shirts hooked up w a girls gym teacher
710811692,michelle will be delighted when sasha and malia show up with lesbian girlfriends yeah sure she will maybe sasha can be the first lesbian president then this might make sense
710811692,these malignant malcontents want to talk about anything but the economy including but not limited to the first cow
710811692,she left out sexual perversion moral cess pool
710811692,tell me are you truely this stupid naturally or did you have to work at it
710811692,tell me are you truly an asshole that can't spell or did you have to work at it
710811692,who cares what the rest of the world thinks bright examples of a better america i guess you missed the part about how obama has destroyed the economy and myriad other issues your comment leaves the reader to believe that you view yourself by what others think of you rather than being able to look in the mirror and telling yourself this is who i am and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks
710811692,just swell maybe sasha and malia can marry each other why not
710811692,sounds good to me
710811692,hahahahaha that's truly funny oo especially the flannel shirt i can see the visual of girls softball catcher batting clean up right now you watch though you'll get heckled for that comment and i'll be jagged right along with you the thinness of the lefts skin layer is astounding right now the obama machine is whining about axelrod getting shouted down yesterday but they can't explain why he was there to begin with he is a terrible speaker he got all flustered and then pulled a few good men's you cant handle the truth schtick looking even more feeble for having done so couple that with the news today regarding the unemployment rate increase and the dow down nearly points and you can see the beads of sweat coming from all the loony left highly much more intelligent than any one of us and all the other sophisticated uber educated types they are all to a tee becoming unhinged more quickly than i anticipated and obama is on television right now blathering once again the same old the worst recession since the great depression mantra good grief what a whining crybaby this president really is he simply will not accept any personal responsibility for anything and yet here is his man wife actually talking about lesbian marriage and using her daughters as some kind of relevant or cogent example remember these are the same two birds who gave the queen of england dvd's that wouldn't even play on a british based dvd player because they have a different region code over there seriously the buffoonery never stops you can just see the literal hatred in their eyes and yet all we here is how intelligent they both are about how classy they are and how elegant and articulate they are the supreme courts imminent decision on the obama health care mandate may very well be what puts them all over the edge where is dusty rhodes the wrassler when you need him i can hear him right now with that lisp and southern drawl this is serious risky business and you need to be cleaner than a safeway chicken
710811692,you think greece is laughing right now just exactly who is laughing about or at the u s france spain the united muslim kingdom name a country instead of an entire planet please at least try to be cogent once you arrive at a country that is laughing at the u s perhaps then we can reduce your planetary boast into something that one can get their arms around because millions upon millions of americans are concerned about the homosexual agenda's attempt to change the meaning of a word i don't think anything is funny about it at all and if you don't mind neene when did you receive the authority or imprimatur to speak on behalf of the world you mentioned the world twice in the same gay post that's rather bold and assumptive don't you think are you a top or a bottom the couple you mention are not all that bright neene
710811692,her decision to voluntarily inactivate her law license probably came right after she probably learned she was being investigated and didn't want the details to come out i don't know that for a fact but it certainly wouldn't surprise me why would anyone who worked so hard to go to law school and take the test for the bar just give it up voluntarily
710811692,if obama is so bright then explain why he refused to release his college transcripts what were his sat scores what was his gpa what is he hiding oh and by the way i suggest you start reading some foreign newspapers and see what the rest of the world really thinks about them i'll tell you this much they thought bush was bad but cannot believe the american people were stupid enough to elect this buffoon obama is perceived as weak and incompetent
710811692,sociopath narcissists which obama is never admit being wrong and always find someone or something else to blame for their own personal failures like tsunami's atm's gw bush and on and on
710811692,joe c'mon guy wikipedia and wiki answers cannot always be cited as fact in an argument especially when the sources of the information are not even revealed starting from around the th or th grade most students who make statements in an essay have to quote their sources via a formal bibliography the link you provided has absolutely no sources mentioned or cited which means that it may be nothing more than someone's opinion which is fine for sure and so is your opinion just as important and cool but until that wiki answer link you attached above is actually sourced then it is only opinion and cannot be relied upon as pure fact the link in the wiki answer page is merely a link to the current rules and regs on the disbarment process and just because it is referred to in the wiki answer it does not refer to michelle obama in any way that is the dilemma of relying on these publicly written and publicly edited quasi social networking style of so called reference material like all the wiki's are and a common trick of the left is to craft pages such as the one you proffered up for example just because the ardc is included in the wiki answer it does not automatically make the rest of the un sourced opinion accurate or reliable or even related to michelle obama's situation you can use it to bolster your own opinion and that is fine but in debates only sourced facts win the day i am saying this to you because like you i am also often opinionated and what i might post is nothing more than my opinion
710811692,what a nasty first lady yesterday she was totally rude to the bush family and only showed up for the photo opportunity and left quickly after i guess she can not stand the competition of laura bush who is a true lady and michelle lacks the manners tack and deplomacy she is not a nice lady
710811692,i can't help but think there's got to be a growing concensus to put gays back in their effing closet every day in every way we're being bombarded with this gay message on line in the news and in every corner of the entertainment industry just today marvel comics announced that the green lantern is gay i hope the gays ramp up their aggressive marriage fight i hope they campaign constantly i hope obama and biden french kiss at the convention this summer to celebrate their new bisexuality sooner or later people will realize that gays won't stop until heterosexual relationships are deemed a mental illness and having children an abnormal psychology
710811692,michelle obama is a fat pig who looks like a pre opp transsexual no one cares what this ' amazon thinks
710811692,really how about both of her girls come to her as youngsters and say they are gay and they want to marry women i wonder how pro lgbt michele and michele's mamma will be ok with encouraging teenagers to and pre teens to explore being gay the problem is there are some people who are actually born gay and they have lumped themselves together with people who arguably have various forms of mental illness now their mission is to make the whole world gay and accepting of this whole lgbt nonsense michele obama nor her mother would want the obama children aspiring to be gay or one the other letters represented in lgbt michele obama is a big phony just like that clown she married
710811692,what a pathetic first lady if you can call her that
710811692,honey i know puberty is a hard and very confusing time maybe you're so confused and its o k but maybe you're a slit licker i hate these groups in our schools
710811692,i wonder if moooshell brought into the conversation with her daughters the term sodomites
710811692,spare me your bs wookie it was pandering for votes nothing more nothing less
710811692,that's first ho
710811692,i hope mochelle will be happy when her two girls find nice girls to marry mommy and daddy will be so proud
710811692,manchelle needs to shut her trap no one elected her to anything she can take her fairness garbage and shove it where the sun don't shine
710811692,obama is perceived as weak and incompetent actually he is weak and incompetent the world is laughing at the usa for electing a guy who isn't even experienced enough to run a lemonade stand meanwhile the st silverback is talking about lezbos i hope her two girls turn out queer
710811692,she has no idea what a lady is
710811692,michelle obama anal sex is comfortable
710811692,oh moo chelle just sit down and shut up
710811692,yay another right wing fanatic who loves to project sexual crap onto those he hates yay
710811692,so mooch tells her daughters a perverted life style is fine and dandy
710811692,the future belongs to the breeders
710811692,ms obama is an ignorant person nobody i know wants marriage to be applicable to homosexuals but nobody i know wants to deny them whatever the privileges of marriage are we want the to have the higher marriage tax alimony child support and property settlement agreements yes we want them to have civil unions with all the rights and liabilities pertaining to marriage we want no aging bigots like parents in the present minority communities saying our son is dying so get out of his hospital room and his house not fair if ms obama is really about being the same she should decree that all of us have to have a protruding lower jaw as does she and require us to have the surgery if you work at your expense if you won't work at the expense of someone who does to make it so
710811692,joe nobody just ups and volunteers to give up their law license she was investigated for fraud and gave up her license to avoid any political ramifications to the the career of b hussein obamalama
710811692,wow i don't know how you people survive being so hateful it must be a miserable existence live and let live stop worrying about two consenting adults who love each other don't like homosexuality don't be gay oh wait that hasn't worked for larry craig maybe one day you'll have to admit that homosexuality isn't hurting anyone and it's simply an act of love and kindness between two people honestly just calm down gay marriage is inevitable you might as well stop getting your panties in a bun over it
710811692,how is gay marriage sexual if i say my sister just got married would that be sexual now what if i said she married a woman suddenly it's sexual we're talking about equal rights under the law we're talking about not discriminating based on sexual orientation or more specifically gender it has nothing to do with sex it has to do with love and commitment
710811692,the gay message what that homosexuals are people too that homosexuals have never hurt anyone and are just trying to live a happy life without discrimination yeah that's an agenda i want to destroy sarcasm sooner or later people will realize that gays won't stop until heterosexual relationships are deemed a mental illness and having children an abnormal psychology that's a slippery slope fallacy google that term
710811692,i'm fairly certain she wouldn't care if one of her daughters was a lesbian not everyone is a conservative nutjob who would disown their child for no reason and their mission is to make everyone gay so no straight person in history has ever supported gay rights they all became gay still probably the most sound logic i have heard amongst these comments i'll give you that much
710814631,was this for all the moving vans as people move out of the liberal states
710814631,the number is positive and a substantial improvement over the gop's loss a month handed to obama
710829644,several years ago the state of new hampshire decided to get rid of all the deer in the state but it did not stop the spread of lyme disease whitefooted mice and birds are the main carriers of deer ticks i got lyme disease way back in the 's but was misdiagnosed by doctors and medical centers i diagnosed my husband and myself in if we had not been treated aggressively by a lyme literate doctor we may have ended up in a nursing home we need to join forces and share information with all the other states who share this lyme epidemic new york conn new jersey georgia minn california etc etc pennsylvania leads the nation with the most cases of lyme disease we live in elk county and share the distinction of being first along with cameron county with the most cases of lyme for the past years
710829644,it's been clearly shown that decreasing the deer population decreases the deer tick population and the incidence of lyme disease for instance in bridgeport ct lowering the deer population resulted in a decrease in nymphal deer ticks in groton ct the deer population was reduced from per square mile to per square mile and the lyme disease incidence decreased by this makes sense because the adult deer ticks require a large mammal to reproduce the mice and birds can host the smaller larvae and nymphs but these come from the eggs laid by the adults killing the deer stops the cycle
710829644,from the beginning the seriousness of lyme disease has been downplayed as has the role of the epidemic deer which are true biological wmd we were lured into iraq in quest of fictitious wmd and told we would be greeted as liberators and that iraqi oil would pay for our expenses similarly we were told lyme was easy to spot bulls eye and easy to cure one pill all lies many people don't have a bulls eye rash and one pill is generally inadequate
710829644,public health officials dangerously downplay the dangers of the lyme disease epidemic it is represented as being easy to diagnose and cure yet most infections are transmitted by the minute poppy seed sized nymphs which are often not noticed especially when in the hair etc of victims never have a rash and the rash which is often not the advertised bulls eye is frequently missed of patients initially treated with antibiotics go on to develop symptoms joints brain heart etc later an increasing number are developing other co infections since the deer tick carries many diseases
710829960,now i wasn't there but i'll bet the ones that slaughtered all those women and children in such a cowardly devilish way were iranians i have know a lot of syrians during my life and i have a hard time believing that any syrian could do such a soul burning cowardly thing it had to be the iranians
710834047,dear representative pearce we may be in different aisles and states but i could not agree with you more as long as it is responsible maybe people in the chambers need to be educated on culling the dead doesn't grow it just burns faster and planting techniques we don't need strip logging we need companies committed to the environment and that still understand the importance of good lumber as it becomes scacer they cant be asked just to clean up they need to be shown an incentive to do it by regulations i remember years ago helping my father cut marked trees in the state forests of northwest nj for our wood burning stove he paid a permit fee and only took what was marked i am green and clean but cannot be scared into the dying of every species of insect or bird they're resilient if it is a forest owned by a government there will be no building bend a little greenpeace thank you and good luck jeffrey korkes
710834047,pearce the biggest hindrance is the u s forest service bureaucracy in washington which caters to extreme interest groups that stop responsible forest management seriously of course you are referring to the sierra club who's life's existence is to see to it our great grandchildren will be able to enjoy the same natural resources we do i'm sure any thinking person wouldn't present much of an argument against that do you see climate change as a threat to the forests you don't see the fact that the gila which is millions of years old isn't managing it's self against this serious drought and global climate change your insensitive callous attitude towards lumber profits over the environment is not helping fight the blight heat and drought is it sure if you clear cut from winston to glenwood and you would cut the fire hazard though somehow clear cutting the birthplace of geronimo doesn't seem like such healthy forest management pearce because the forest service refuses to permit logging in our forests they are overcrowded with trees that go up in flames really most third graders understand that forest and trees are synonymous as long as congress was willing to support them the forest service did have a great program in place to help keep the woods thinned out not logged out the north half of the gila and much of the apache have already been logged the clear cuts are a permanent reminder it wasn't managed well before and if you give it away again why should we expect a different result we know that humans have inhabited the gila since way before christ we know that the gila has survived millions of lightning strikes and thousands of burns the only reason we see pristine acres and growing going up in smoke is because the gila has never been this dry your blaming environmentalists for this what a joke you're making of yourself and all of us how does it feel to be the congressman of the district that once proudly held some of the west's most valued and pristine wilderness how does it feel to see it all go up in smoke
710837488,gayism with all its attendant demands on age long societal values is not a civil right or equality matter as michel would want us believe it is probably difficult for barack and his wife to tell us the actual reason they have taken this position whether this is heart conviction or a calculated political move will become clearer in future let us be honest with our selves this gay problem is all about us and our belief in god if one does not believe in god it wouldnt matter to him what any one sleeps with or marries if one supports gayism such a person cannot by any stretch of logic also claim to believe in god i speak of the jehova god who sent jesus into the world to die for sinners also common sencialy what is wrong with the way things are if it is not broken why fix it men and women are happy are all ver the world being married why is the west campaigning ruin the world

710860898,brent you're a hack you have never been right about anything i've ever read of yours
710860898,if folks didn't live beyond their means they wouldn't have to be concerned about interest rates on their credit cards debt is dumb learn about economics from the folks who predicted all of this long before it happened www mises org
710860898,if elizabeth warren thought up ows it's just one more reson not to elect her ows is a thinly veiled left wing radical group of democra brwn shirts
710860898,ows is a spooky dude union communist manufactured obama bill ayers dream to take down capitalism game is up the banksters are all in bed with the politicans
710860898,well i would reply to guest onceproudamerican or junkanon but then i would be speaking to the same person a minimum wage starving college graduate working in the karl rove propaganda sweatshop i know you go home every night and cry yourself to sleep
710860898,democrats are just as bad as republicans the dems are just better at lip service both sides are out to bend you over the difference is that dem's will buy you dinner first date rape's not a whole lot better than regular rape imo
710860898,dear guest from minutes ago ows is most definitely not a democrat movement people who are actually involved in the occupy movement recognize that democrats and republicans are the same thing your statement shows that you're under informed while the democratic party keeps trying to co opt ows and occupations around the nation the educated and awake amongst us have no inclination to support the democratic party any more than we would the republican both are owned by the and neither has the interests of the people in mind when it comes to legislation of the legislation they actually pass is funded by big business interests or the elite criminal class
710860898,actually junkanon i predicted dems win house and senate in dems win house and senate in obama would be elected in harry reid would be reelected in and that dems keep the senate in your research skills leave something to be desired if you were pinocchio your nose would feet long i note that neither you nor the other rightist hacks have even tried to answer the arguments in this piece so far of course you cannot
710860898,funny not one teacher lost their job in wisconsin but mayor bloomberg fired teachers in new york city to ensure union benefits not one peep from the left
710860898,mises rocks only an idiot would comport with kaynes wacky ideas that have proven time and time again to be failures
710860898,really that is the best response you can come up with launch a personal attack on a person with an opposing view
710860898,e warren and ows speak for the majority of americans on said fairness issues you sure about that i wonder if your journalistic colleague mr armstrong would agree w respect to ms warren's credentials to be a spokeswoman for so many personally i enjoy some of your pieces but i would be careful w that ows doctrine there are far too many self destructive toxins in their doctrine for those that ingest fear them perhaps a few and some others may rise to counter them but most feel pity for them and the way they are manipulated to be blunt they have discredited themselves by their methods btw one does not need the so called virtues of ows to certify some otherwise interesting points
710860898,they don't speak for me nor do they worry me warren is a liar who makes up stories to give her an advantage over honest people the occupiers are just a few dirty hippies smoking pot on street corners none of them occupy my attention the only economic fairness that matters to me is for the government to get out of the way
710860898,it's a dope smoking hippie movement that very few people even notice anymore all laws are passed based on funding by corporations and criminals no wonder we don't take you clowns seriously you're delusional and probably stoned
710860898,it's a handy substitute for facts and logic
710860898,if you mean that republicans are terrified of another self absorbed lying and irresponsible democrat going to wash dc then you would be correct
710860898,gentle readers dear mr budowsky no one ' fears ' ows they're simply petty criminals who commit trespassing vandalism and generally make a huge mess unlike the tea party whom who dislike who rally peacefully get permits for their rallys and clean up after themselves what we fear is that this petty crime will be allowed to destroy our functioning society we fear opportunistic journalists and politicians will allow this type of criminal activity to further their agenda we fear people like you as to ms warren this vile woman is like that vile man sec chu sec chu will solve all of our energy problems by making sure we don't have any he'll solve our highway problems by making it impractical for the american people to own cars ms warren will ' solve ' our credit problems by making sure we don't have access to any credit need a washing machine forget it according to ms warren and her ilk we should work our hands raw to the bone washing clothes by hand in cold water the cop had a nice demonstration set up for that a concrete wash tub with cold water her solution to the mortgage crisis is that people will never buy a house on credit we'll all be renters she'd make sec chu happy by preventing auto finance we'd never own a car if she has her way having a car good roads and owning a home are what most americans consider to be a middle class lifestyle your preferred politicians accuse republicans of waging war on the middle class but in fact they are the ones who would destroy the middle class to further their progressive socialist and malthusian green agendas sincerely john lepant brighton co
710860898,you also predicted the democrats would retain the house in that caroline kennedy would be the next senator from new york that al gore would enter the election that scott brown would lose the special election in ma that the economy would be great last summer and this summer shall i continue brent you still have yet to address the fact that ows members in cleveland attempted to blow up a bridge and murder americans everyone should be terrified of being blown up by ows terrorists i understand why you support them you still have failed to address why liz warren has lied about what she told harvard about being cherokee and about her plagiarized recipes she submitted to a book titled pow wow chow you are a paid hack and a joke
710860898,yes and he also failed to mention that the commie in chief has his good friend van jones running the ows another commie thug
710860898,brent some democrats do not fear warren or ows they are disgusted by their promotion of anarchy over the rule of law get a clue liz is a liar and ows is clueless lawless and violent that my friend is not a winning combination for this representative republic how about ows blows a bridge in support of fauxcahontus that will do it ows ought to go protest the colleges that are ripping them of big time like harvard warren ought to step down for the good of the party
710860898,many democrats don't want another business hating radical elected either
710860898,another distraction from obama's record by the paid hack budowsky all this spring brent touted the jobs reports as obama's policies working well todays jobs report was a disaster where is brent with his reaction to this news brent you are a liar and a paid hack who supports liars like warren and terrorists like the ows who tried to blow up a bridge in cleveland answer these questions true or false members of the cleveland ows tried to blow up a bridge in cleveland todays job report was bad really bad at a paltry k jobs and aprils numbers were sharply revised down from k to k
710860898,well said what about that bridge the mainstream media didn't really cover that why not no wonder many are calling them lame stream they cover what is favorable to their own twisted ideology how sad
710860898,fresh news it seems that liz warren used foreclosures on homes to enrich herself and family even allowing a foreclosure on the family of an iraq war veteran brent your continued blind support for people like warren and the ows is despicable omg you are such a disgusting human being
710860898,omg occupy is a bunch of lowlife terrorists i can't believe anyone would dare proclaim they represent the majority of americans as for elizabeth warren at first i thought her ridiculous claims about being a native american were funny now i think that woman is certifiably insane it's not just the native american thing she says crazy stuff all the time like being the st woman to ever breastfeed and take the bar exam or inventing ows seriously if i was her campaign manager i would be questioning her sanity
710860898,the beginning of ows may have started as grassroots the evidence of far left radicals and anarchists fingerprints are all over the bankrolls of the protests yes most politicans are crooks starting at the top down who will you vote for obama is in bed with the geithners summers goldmans and jaime diamonds on wall st i'm sure romney will play right along
710860898,tell warren to go back to her tribe
710860898,oooooh elizabeth warren and ows ooooooh soooo scary buddy you are flat out delusional
710860898,brent why do you bother with this tripe it is so unintelligent trivial and inessential that it boggles the mind why you would even write this drivel warren and occupy wallstreet are mindless contumelious pompus idiots living off the prosperity of others and demanding equality for services they never deserved or warranted all they do is demand without offering anything useful to those provider their due reward in return
710860898,oh sorry brent so you can understand warren and occupy wallstreet are about as worthy of our attention as a fart in a whorlwind
710860898,she is with her tribe the tribe of usefull idiots you know progressives and occupy wallstreet idiots
710860898,the reason that credit card interst rates are so high is because so many do not pay thier bills the democrats have done a great job of allowing many in our society to avoid or feel like they are responsible for their actions so why not buy a house you cannot afford why not buy toys on a credit card why have insurance like so much that goes on today those of us that are responsible pay our bills pay our taxes keep our insurance current go to work everyday are the ones getting slammed
710860898,this is just stupid i own a house because i got a favorable mortgage and if i didn't i'd probably rent a place i pay off my credit cards every month because i don't want to pay interest charges i have friends who travel more go to restaurants more and have huge credit card bills they often brag to me that they got a new card transferred their balances to a new card and get an unbelievably low interest rate a couple of them have declared backruptcy after years of this another just got a mortgage when i asked how many points they paid for their interest rate they had no idea he wasn't an unsophisticated person he just didn't check at some point it seems to me that living within your means should be the national cry instead of keeping those wall street jerks in line
710860898,brent obviously never witnessed and occupy demonstration if he did the stench of the great unwashed would have killed him dead in his tracks
710860898,why do they fear her because she blows the whistle on their corrupt racket
710860898,buddy your a very lost sheep adbusters stole an idea and try to use it to it to their own gain so you have no idea this is a spiritual movement to the highest degree yes you don't have anything to fear if your doing the right thing otherwise we will expose you for what you are that simple
710860898,ows is a joke even the dems try to distance themselves this is an excellent example of an out of touch reporter america is sick of those dirty protesters
710860898,if you dont want to pay rate on a credit card dont get one its called individual responsibility dont want a bad mortgage dont sign for one i had a woman tried to sell me a interest only i asked the right questions and realized she was nusto america does not need the dems and government to hold out hands to cross the street apparently brent does
710860898,as i expected the new boston globe poll shows warren even with brown the totality of impact of the phony ancestry issue is this zero a total non issue except for birther types
710860898,i fear nothing occupies your small brain speaking of getting government out of the way why do republicans keep getting in the way of a womans right to choose gregerikson
710860898,mikel you need to do your homework massive forced retirements and layoffs were are common in wisconsin schools as a result of walker's union busting
710860898,the boston globe also states the following the vast majority of voters percent said the issue would not affect their vote but percent of self described independents a critical voting bloc said the issue makes them less likely to support warren in november so much for your assumption that it will not make any difference remember it is the independences who will actually make the difference
710860898,noticed that you actually had nothing of importance to say other than you talking points stick to it it let's everybody know just where your head is buried
710860898,on the issues of fairness in finance economics and consumerism elizabeth warren and the occupy wall street movement speak for the majority of americans this is so off the wall i'm left speechless just plain nutz jeff
710860898,at some point it seems to me that living within your means should be the national cry instead of keeping those wall street jerks in line seems most 'normal americans' have at least a basic understanding of that now about the gov't jeff
710860898,you support terrorists who try to blow up bridges liars like warren who we are finding out enriched herself and her family through purchasing foreclosures even letting a house foreclose on a family of an iraq war veteran you are disgusting
710860898,you rock
710860898,yes they fear her because she fights for most americans whilst they plead that the super rich need even more money and the poor need none idiots con job servatives
710860898,they cannot with their well trained eyes to avoid the truth
710860898,ah ou so delight in letting others know that you are an idiot
710860898,jeff big guy let's see what manner of man you are how many voters do you believe want to be charged mafia like credit card interest rates by banks what percentage of voters do you believe want to be ripped off by banks on rates could this be why this nobody but armstrong williams cares about the attack on elizabeth's ancestry what is your number dude how many voters do you believe want to be ripped off by banks i have more if you dare to answer this one
710860898,lepantzeus if you fear me be brave have courage grow some cojones ii promise you you have no reason to be afraid of me what water do many on the right drink that half the time you try to play on the fear of others the other half you always seem to be afraid of something
710860898,hahahaha this piece is from the onion right hahahaha see ya in november sucker romney our next president
710860898,no one has anything to fear from the left as europe is illustrating for the entire world they always self destruct ows never had more than participants worldwide including public employee union paid participants paid homeless protestors and even paid prostitutes in nyc a fact admitted by the dnc the tea party conversely has participants according to abc ap and million according to cbs nyt now you know why the election was the the largest electoral victory in american history with seats changing from democrat to republican why dems have resigned from the us house prior to the election joining democrats who have resigned from the senate and why year incumbent richard lugar was defeated by a pt margin in the indiana senate race joining utah senator bob bennet in forced retirement how many politicians has ows succeeded in ousting how many has it succeeded in electing i think the current total is zero on both counts but feel free to correct me if i am wrong on that point
710860898,not so much the idea of protestors in terms of the function of legitimate protest in a democracy but rather the tactics employed by ows small and insignificant as the movement is which resulted in more than arrests in boston injured police officers vandalism and fires in oakland and multiple arrests in atlanta as well the lack of a coherent message as well as the prevalence of violence indicates that many ows protestors are simply anarchists looking for an excuse to riot
710860898,normally i don't give likes for sarcastic posts but the reference to the onion made me crack up
710860898,credit card debt is voluntary unlike taxation
710860898,actually it is the rape and assault and the drug use and the other criminal activity that is why i fear ows elizabeth warren eh not so much
710860898,as usual brent is looking in the wrong direction brent has no concern about government corruption in the form of phony and suspect loans to the obama supporters who stole over a billion from the taxpayers no 'tis better to be focused on private equity of billion than to focus on a billion money laundering scheme of obama's called a stimulus brent you wouldn't make a pimple on a real reporter's posterior
710860898,yes this election is about fairness for the american peoplem finally can we beat the money pouring in by an unfair supreme court decesion which makes them look partisan unethical and no longer trustworthy to do their job for the people it is obvious that that once great body needs also to be reformed
710860898,not one teacher lost their job in wisconsin where have you been hundreds of teachers lost their jobs that is what this recall is all about the unfair layoffs of public sector workers and the weakening of the unions people need to get educated before they speak not unless they don't want to speak truth
710860898,and the stench of corruption is not worse the loss of lives from an illegal war is not worse lives runied by greedy speculators who took homes pensions for their own gain
710860898,translation when liberals don't get their way they want to change the rules
710860898,the right fears elizabeth warren and occupy wall street because they speak with principle cannot be bought with dirty money and speak for a majority of voters on issues of financial corruption and consumer rights those who oppose warren and ows represent the worst collection of dirty corrupt money ever assembled they are probably paying minimum wage to buy some of the clumsy right wing comments that read like they are written by high school or college students here and elsewhere
710860898,what anthony replied i am shocked that some people able to get paid in month on the computer have you read this site link pr ouml ugrave dr iacute ch ccedil om
710860898,and the occupy movement is still supporting obama and his minions get ahold of the truth obama is the greedy speculators and van jones is obamas hand in occupy
710860898,unfortunately the onion gets the tone of coverage more right than the actual media such as in bipartisan spirit obama makes deal to get kicked in balls president obama works out an agreement to have republicans in congress kick him in the balls in exchange for nothing
710860898,astrophysics brent
710860898,brent no one fears you we all laugh at you still supporting ows that tried to blow up a bridge and murder americans
710860898,ows have assaulted police destroyed property and tried to blow up a bridge in cleveland and murder americans reports of rape of underage girls are reported in every city they protest liz warren while pretending to be cherokee for personal gain plagiarizing recipes for a book title pow wow chow also purchased foreclosure homes for herself and her family enriching herself off the including profiting yes profiting on a foreclosed home of an iraq war veteran brent supports all of that because he is paid to do so brent is a paid hack of the dnc and mediamatters i mean seriously no one could write the crap brent writes and tell the half truths and lies that brent tells without being paid he is a despicable man playing to our differences and only concerned with the game of politics for his side brent you disgust me
710860898,a healthy helping of big lie propaganda that was as goebbels learned from the left if you tell a lie often enough people might well believe it the occu poopers are funded by the owners of the democrat party such as george soros supplied with rent a thugs by the democrat party's astroturfing organs and aided and abetted by democrat city gov'ts and the msm granted the democrats will probably eventually betray them by encouraging them to take to the streets then using them as a pretext to shred what civil liberties we still have but as some blue state policeman cracks thier skull open with a truncheon they can rest assured it's for the good of the party
710860898,like fauxahontas who was flipping foreclosed houses to make money for her and her relatives but i guess that's ok now since a democrat is doing it like lying about one's race to qualify for affirmative action
710860898,what they don't realize is the party leadership is preparing a night of the long knives for them timed to drop shortly after they take to the streets and set our cities ablaze this summer in obedience to their paymaster soros
710860898,if you're going to compare the way republicans and democrats interact with banksters ect with sex you could at least get it right the gop leadership is like a kept woman who gets her rent paid and nice clothes and all she has to do in return is to be ready for the call from her lover that leads to dinner and a movie before having some hot passionate adulterous sex before he goes home to the wife and kids the dem leadership is like a televangelist who preaches against the evils of homosexuality and drugs yet spends his evenings with his bare buttocks pressed against a glory hole in a gay bar bathroom stall accommodating people he despises because he needs the money to support his cocaine habit
710860898,not even close to the truth the only school districts that laid teachers off were the ones that signed contracts with unions in a rush before walker's reforms those that didn't were able to save millions of dollars on their health insurance contracts and kept personnel as a result
710860898,she's made a laughingstock out of herself and highlightedall the corruption in academia with affirmative action
710860898,can we beat the money pouring in by an unfair supreme court decesion which makes them look partisan unethical and no longer trustworthy to do their job for the people hint it's not the job of the supreme court to be 'fair' their job is to do legal intrepretation per the constitution by definition that's not always going to be 'fair' and as for 'how they look' myself i'd rather have someone who doesn't care how they 'look' but does care that they do their job properly anyone that worries about 'looks' over 'principles' cares more about appearance than substance not always a good thing jeff
710860898,is this a story from the onion blog pure fantasy ew and ows speak for no one but themselves
710860898,what anthony replied i am shocked that some people able to get paid in month on the computer have you read this site link pr ouml ugrave dr iacute ch ccedil om
710860898,these republcans crack me up dick morris and john feehery write these columns predicting gigantic republcan landslides they are just making it up as they go along
710860898,btw if elizabeth warren is even in the polls after three weeks of the holy roller right attacking her ancestry it is time to write a column calling her the teflon candidate scott brown is in some trouble and i will predict elizabeth creams him in theiir debates when brown defends the banks
710860898,like most paid liberal hacks you miss the point liz warren lied about her ancestory and when and who she told about it but since you give the ows a pass for trying to blow up a bridge and murder americans what are a few lies you are disgusting person
710860898,you were cracked up a long time ago after obama loses in november it is off to the ols folks home for you
710860898,no she is fighting for all the people she is encouraging others to use their evolved empathy to help each other she is trying to get people to use the general welfare clause to help us all she is fighting against unethical business behavior and those on the right who do as you maintain the free market does not award as it ought in that the bottom rung of workers deserve more in wages and the top gets an unjust exponential salary taxes are the way to satisfy just wages one owes more progressively as that means that all feel the brunt of taxation the ouch principle the rich in return get better educated employes better roads for their goods to market and so forth ti's unjust the overly unequality unequality is just otherwise no such as she do not harm the people they empower them through workfare unemployment benefits and such to pursue their life liberty and the pursuit of happiness actually don't pursue happpiness but let it come with your actions liberal capitalism is the known moral practical ideal otherwise capitalism becomes the road to serfdom spencer randism does not work for the people
710860898,a simple plan to put the poor back to work and stop the republican't welfare and food stamp revival first if we let all the tax cuts and military spending cuts end on january first and we take half of the savings to pay off the debt and the other half on infrastructure do you think this could save our country and finally put the unemployed back to work second does giving tax breaks tax holidays and tax loopholes to the rich really do anything to stimulate our economy when they are buying foreign made goods and manufacturing in foreign markets in my opinion the u s works best when you tax the rich and put the poor to work not in china but in the united states third remove tax incentives for outsourcing jobs and make tax holidays on returning foreign sweatshop profits illegal
710860898,obama should have killed bush cheneys bailout of the banks he should have invested the fifteen trillion in green technology he should have put americanworkers back to work and stop the import of oil he should have put the corporate crooks in jail he should have put bush cheney in jail
710860898,now you know better than asking a republican't to tell the truth they have no morals only their greed for wealth and their lust for power the red communist republican't and their corporate communist sweatshop partners never apologize and never admit anything no matter how many the bankrupt or kill these people are ruthless and even power and gold won't satisfy their hunger i just feel sorry for the chineseworkers that the republican't has enslaved

710860898,stupidity they wear their blinders on or just use their well trained eyes of prejudice to influence their opinions
710860898,no willard won't win because he lies and lies and lies and is just another randroid m l g lamberth
710860898,lies don't make truth willard lies duane gish and hannity capped and o'rly lie libertarians lack perspective murray rothbard is a nutcase says yes to blackmail and treating ones children badly
710860898,no rational person cares about such picayune matters but does care about willard's lies about the president and his own randroid ideas
710860898,fool why be an advocate for allowing scams fool
710860898,dear russell bowles and everybody we hear a great deal about corruption in other countries i e greece but the u s diverts more of our tax base than any other country to wealthy and privileged individuals international giant corporations and very many self indulgent money sinks the difference is that in the u s has institutionalized this corruption and made it legal big money has purchased our federal legislative bodies we have the best government money can buy with citizens united the u s supreme court has joined in and is encouraging the corruption all restraints are off it appears that the current election will be an orgy of calculated lies and appeals to the lizard brain as we become a legal plutocracy goodbye democracy henry nyals
710868089,nuclear energy only provides of the energy in the u s of energy and trillions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies and leaving a legacy of deadly nuclear waste for thousands of years is it worth it no is it necessary no nuclear meltdowns have caused radiation in our food and water supply we could easily conserve of energy and transition into renewable energy sources like europe is doing so successfully and with renewable energy like solar wind geothermal and tidal wave there's no need to go to war for oil etc with renewable energy there is clean energy independence a few examples iceland utilizes of geothermal energy successfully germany utilizes wind and solar hugely successfully denmark utilizes wind energy hugely successfully renewable energy is so successful that germany has to turn off the wind power because it's creating too much energy the trillions of dollars that has been invested in nuclear energy which is such a heavy polluter and since fukushima and chernobyl has shown us is so dangerous should be used to fund renewable energy
710874075,no need to go to congress panetta and obama will have the un make all our decisions
710877525,living in fairy tale land must be very nice when there is no basis in fact for your statement obama has not created million jobs we are all still waiting for those shovel ready jobs but keep thinking those thoughts it is always nice to dream once again the dems are playing the blame game and it is never ever their fault it is always someone elses fault
710877525,oh for pity's sake not again dear democrats knock it off grow up take responsibility
710877525,and so house democrats do what they do best point fingers and assign blame is it any wonder our country is in such terrible shape it would be so nice for one of our leaders to accept responsibility for the jobs report and admit that they need to do better unfortunately the culture in washington is one in which no one accepts blame for anything starting with the president our elected officials point fingers at anyone but themselves and say it's not my fault it's pathetic and it needs to change in november
710877525,house democrats can blame themselves for kowtowing to the radical queen of mean herself nancy pelosi obama reid and pelosi are the trifecta winners of the rac to the bottom
710877525,that's the solution to chronically unexpectedly stubbornly high unemployment build a highway but i thought we repaired all the highways following obama's trillion stimulus remember those shovel ready jobs that weren't so shovel ready yuck yuck the sad fact is there is a persistent of americans who will believe this latest vacuous drivel from pelosi
710877525,many of those shovel ready jobs would be initiated as a result of the transportation bill being approved the transportation bill would create a lot of jobs and sure up those numbers but certainly would not put them into an impressive arena republican obstructionism has halted much of the legislative process to the point where nothing job related has passed in months but they just play the role of aggressor being as it is a democratic administration its a group effort that growth is slowing don't expect anything to be done until the lame duck aka when it is too late to fully understand the two parties goals
710877525,absolutely correct just look how gleeful the republicans are about any bad news for the american people it's sad and pathetic this is all they want for our economy
710877525,nancy your depend is full again please change it
710877525,ms pelosi doesn't realize that everything else that her and her cohorts have done has not created jobs so why should the gop spend a zillion dollars again just for it to fail again i say kudos to the gop for their obstructernism it doesn't take taxpayer money to start jobs it takes your presidents obstructernism to stop stop regulating coal mines power plants oil companies car companies etc who can create more jobs if he would stop shutting all of them down there is the real obstructernism get your damn thumb off job creators
710877525,mr cantor what have you and boehner done lately or ever to help america recover from bush recession zero you are gleeful that your game plan is working remember your famous meeting with ryan gingrich and others on the day of obama's inauguration to obstruct every obama administration initiative to fix the bush economy ever since you have been doing just that tank the economy refuse to cooperate with obama and then blame obama you are not coming to this debate about the economy with a clean hand buddy you surely think americans are stupid and wouldn't notice and would reward republicans nonetheless that wouldn't happen in november you can bet on it
710877525,the biggest difference between the present administration that of president romney is that the romney administration will conduct business on an adult level
710877525,that will never happen when will people realize they are purposely destroying america vote em out
710877525,you are a complete idiot politicians do not repeat after me do not create any jobs damn you are dumb
710877525,lol it is obstructing dem socialist communist policies that made it less of a catastrophe than it already is
710877525,the republicans will not approve any new additional debt spending so right now they want to limit the transportation spending to the amount brought in by the gasoline tax the democrats want to spend more and the republicans want to spend more the republicans only want any increases in the transportation to be paid for by reducing other spending the democrats refuse in a yearly budget of trillion there has got to be a place that can be cut billion
710877525,sorry but the teapublicans control the house
710877525,sorry nan but your party had complete control of congress for four years and the last two of those years you had obama in the white house you can spread that fertilizer anywhere you want but it isn't going to grow anything the last fiscal budget deficit passed before you took over was billion you helped increase that number up to to trillion you may not realize this nancy but george w bush hasn't been president since january years ago hope you're enjoying your position as minority leader because you won't be getting another chance to hold that gavel again
710877525,public sector jobs are still being cut still waiting on those job creators who've hade a ten year tax holiday to create some jobs
710877525,bull the house added tens of billions to the war machine funding they happily said yes to over billion to the militray industrial complex republicans do not care about deficits they never have that's why they created the largest expansion of the federal government in a generation when they had power remember the tsa home land security patriot act medicare part d no child left behind all of those are republican not paid for federal government expansions
710877525,dumbocrats like reid and pelosi should have approved the keystone pipeline and the many other energy and other jobs creating projects that republicans have sent there way instead of pushing uncompetitive risky green boondoggles can you say solyndra no the democrat leadership and obama can take the blame for the lack of jobs creation in the u s the buck stops at the top
710877525,oh except for the military industrial complex right
710877525,fact there is no limit to the damage republicans can do to this country thank you democrats for continuing to fight for our country
710877525,dr would have us spend more money we don't have tax everyone more double the rate on businesses then he would not pay his own taxes want more give away programs
710877525,republicans conservatives tea partiers and all freedom loving americans are gleeful not because of the bad news of the continued suffering of our fellow citizens but because the truth is finally breaking through the iron curtain of obama and his propagandist media the only way obama is defeated and this madness of marxist obamanomics ends is if people live the same misery here in america that socialism has wrought on the entire globe over the last century history is replete with people trying to escape the fairness of marxist economics at the risk of their lives east germany cuba the balkans poland china el salvador wherever marxism is tried the results are the same misery except for the of elites who rule over everyone else so why do people on the left who have enjoyed unprecedented freedom and prosperity in this country want what the rest of the world has tried to escape there can only be one answer liberalism progressive ism socialism marxism communism obamaism insanity
710877525,pelosie and her dumbazz house wasted years passing an unconstitutional health care bill instead of working on jobs this dumbazz should be sent to jail for illegale stock trades

710877525,america will never be able to fully recover until conservative lawmakers and republican politicians stop their strategy of jobs sabotage and get on the page of helping this country not just their own political aspirations mitt romney and the other republicans bashing the president for his jobs policies are going to have to surrender to reality soon enough and change their talking points or risk being laughed off the national stage millions of jobs were created last year something every republican has consistently lied about now is not the time to cut off the growth of jobs with a toxic conservative agenda of spending cuts and more government handouts to billionaires www sunstateactivist org
710877525,you forgot to take your meds truzak
710877525,he he he he he he he he he bwahahahahahahaha bwwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhhaaaaahhhhaaaahhhhaaaa bwahahahaha oh god thank you democraps for continuing to fight for our country bwahahahahahahahahaha oh god thank you for that bwahahahaha he he he ooooooo god thank you

710877525,you leftards got every damn thing through congress that you wanted during year i of the imperial reign of obozo where's the jobs you promised less than unemployment at this point it's effectively over so shut up
710877525,you're an idiot the last house was by far more prodcutive then this curent do nothing block everything house pelosi passed over bills just so the gop in the senate could filibuster them
710877525,industry moron industry look up the word
710877525,house has passed jobs bills harry reid is obstructing them buy noyt having votes and you say
710877525,pelosi and hoyer associate whiners to the whiner in chief hopefully we will be rid of the trash in the white house on january
710877525,yes take responsibility nancy why did you allow the san francisco oakland bridge work to be outsourced to china this move outsourced american jobs to china instead of creating new jobs and economic stimulas for americans here
710877525,blame does not 'get the job done' jeff
710877525,now pelosi wants to do something what an incredible waste of space and seemingly putting a shovel in everyones hand is the democratic answer to this issue how about passing a budget and lets see what is in it you bonehead
710877525,i agree that it was dumb for california to outsource the bay bridge steel to china but you do realize that there is zero federal funding going to that project right
710877525,you're the moron because you think that the government doesn't create jobs that's one of the dumbest things i've heard
710877525,i'm not hiring anyone until obama is removed from office as long as he is in i have no idea what kind of government meddling is going to come next is carol browner the recycled clinton commie still in charge of the job destroying epa even if the supreme court strikes down obamacare he won't stop he'll have sebelius handing down more job killing decrees what new taxes will obama impose by executive order what new job killing union friendly decrees will his jobs czar eric holder and the sec of labor come up with the bush tax cuts are due t expire which will destroy more businesses obama is pushing the eu to bail put greece spain and the other bankrupt socialist states which will magnify the catastrophe the economic uncertainty won't be resolved until he and his crew are out and we have some adults in the wh
710877525,where do you get this nonsense you really think everyone is so involved in ruining obama that is now your excuse same thing over and over it is not my fault it is the other guys fault grow up
710877525,with today's jobs report it's clear that we have work to do pelosi said gee piglosi you had control of the house for years under the worthless pothead and what did you do to create jobs notta zilch zippo zero piglosi is a pig with lipstick
710877525,if public jobs are being cut then what was the point of the trillion dollar failed stimulus which supposedly saved or created them
710877525,worth noting is that the unemployment rate when nancy polosi became house speaker the unemployment rate was under bush the democrats' policies and initiatives have obstructed u s economic progress ever since americans are not buying the blame game any more since the demorats have been in charge way way too loooooong nice try though
710877525,sorry sam the administration owns the economic failure secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau admitted that his new deal was a failure we have tried spending money we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work i want to see this country prosperous i want to see people get a job i want to see people get enough to eat we have never made good on our promises i say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work it was may and morgenthau was appearing before powerful democrats on the house ways and means committee
710877525,heh heh not only that he will have people in his cabinet who have actual experience in what they are supposed to be in charge of rather than these incompetent academics no more academic theories practical experience
710877525,at least now the democrats are admiiting that the economy sucks that is st step let's hope they take a nd step and realize that obama's plan is not working
710877525,i own a business and far from gleeful most people who understand economics saw this coming because of inane economic policy decisions coming from the white house romer summers goolsbee rattner feinberg orszag daley barnes and the entire economic council was fired obama sees the problems with his economic performance but apparently you do not
710877525,worth noting that the gop controlled government during bush created the largest expansion of the federal government in over a generation which of course added millions of federal jobs to the payrolls remember the gop created and passed patriot act tsa homeland security those unpaid for programs added millions of people to the federal payrolls and of course the other bush jobs plans was two wars
710877525,this is one of the liberals favorite arguments look the other guys do it too it's the same argument i hear from my year old child
710877525,stopping the obamunists is critical to saving america the gop house and senators are doing a pretty good job although they caved in on the debt ceiling and they need to hold the line this time obama spent trillion and nothing changed so the idea that more socialism will help is laughable the key to restoring prosperity is to restore freedom by getting the government's boot off the neck of private enterprise job is stopping obama but it's not enough the next step is to roll back socialism as leftwing policies are jettisoned the economy will improve
710877525,well pelosi does own a 'whinery' lol
710877525,then by all means cut them too but the idea that construction workers are going to get an october bailout in order to fraudulently boost unemployment numbers with temporary employment while adding to the deficit to help in the president's re election effort is simply not going to happen there is money that has not yet been spent from the original trillion dollar failed stimulus and there will not be more forthcoming
710877525,fdr disagrees with you as does the architect of the new deal secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau admitted that his new deal was a failure we have tried spending money we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work i want to see this country prosperous i want to see people get a job i want to see people get enough to eat we have never made good on our promises i say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work it was may and morgenthau was appearing before powerful democrats on the house ways and means committee
710877525,ok harry reid why not allow up down votes on the twenty house passed jobs bills you're sitting on show some courage harry just allow votes on thes jobs bills
710877525,your absolutely right gone fishing all the more reason to fire all the paper pushers
710877525,hey hill where's the coverage of the dump obama campaign
710877525,you are quick to change the subject
710877525,gf please note
710877525,are those obama's shovel ready jobs
710877525,don't bother attempting to employ the tactic of projection even democratic members of congress do not believe you the democratic president has fundraisers today alone congressman dennis cardoza announces he will not seek reelection in atwater ca today congressman dennis cardoza d merced issued the following statement formally announcing his decision not to seek re election to congress in looking back on disappointments i am dismayed by the administration s failure to understand and effectively address the current housing foreclosure crisis home foreclosures are destroying communities and crushing our economy and the administration s inaction is infuriating
710877525,jobs bills what a joke none of them have any real jobs impact actually boehner says its
710877525,self party then maybe country the cry of a partisan congress
710877525,nance what did you do in the first two years of obozo nightmare to allow the economy to grow you got the trillion dollar slush fund that failed the decent non union people of america but what did you do with that big majority to actually help employers create jobs
710877525,your choom gangsta savior got everything he wanted what bills exactly did he not get that he wanted hmm
710877525,lmao have you looked around at your failed choom gangsta in chief and the unemployment rate lately obama's not doing drugs anymore neither should you
710877525,remember that unemployment under bush they were until you dems took over
710877525,jobs impact you mean like creating a sustained contributing job in the market or do you mean a job that is based solely on the government printing a check and providing space for which a person may sit and occupy a title democrat's idea is the latter and does nothing but perpetuate a circle of stagnation
710877525,gone fishing your the moron the government has no power to create jobs as its only power is to inhibit even when its promoting it does so by subtraction someplace else if your so smart you tell me how it can create jobs not shift money around so jobs move around but create jobs go ahead i dare you to you wont because doing so would show you your wrong let me make it very simple by making the loop very tiny you have just been called for that gov job and at k your happy however that job is not productive so the job has to be paid for in taxes so they turn around and say you know what the wealthy make too much so lets take from those making more than k now here is the fun part they take this money from the boss that employs your wife the boss that employs your wife fires her to pay taxes to pay for your job he cant afford to pay you through taxes and her too so the state takes that money skims off a big chunk for the guys who you voted in to play this game on you they pay you k and take k back from you skim off some for themselves and pay someone else they pay them but take back which they skim for themselves then they pay someone till its too small now none of those jobs produce anything of value in excess of their costs ie the definition of productivity growth now here is the kicker that you dont get if all the gbovernment jobs went away what would happen to the company and your wife she would have a job you pay bills and so on if the jobs in those companies go away what happens to the state it goes bankrupt as there is nothing to parasite left whole neough to feed them ie the gobernment does not create jobs it creates work it pays for with parasitical action from jobs not the same thing but dont worry my family is from the soviet union and your going to love waht happens to geniuses like you
710877525,the republicans in congress have made it clear that they want obama to fail they have obstructed almost everything he has tried to do especially when it came to helping the economy they have been willing to let the country suffer in order to achieve their own political goals
710877525,shut up your liberal state that claims it is the fourth biggest economy in the world is in worse shape than greece and the rest of the country is bailing your fat a out
710877525,name one jobs bill that the house has passed that has been rated by any independant agency to show how many if any jobs they would create becuase tax cuts for the rich do not create jobs
710877525,nothing is ever obama's fault is it libtards shirk to the left shirk to the right shirking is what you do best taking responsibility that's for republicans right
710877525,what has he presented to help the economy that the gop has obstructed oh you mean those bills for each of the past years that were so bad they couldn't get even one dem vote
710877525,you vote for a european socialist you get european levels of stagnation and unemployment either idiot obungler supporters will wake up to the obvious or we will go the way of greece
710877525,exactely what economic policies has obama pushed and were passed
710877525,this is more of the radical progressive campaign strategy whine and point a finger its so old its got mold it would be funny if it weren't so pathetic the buck never stops with the progressive democrats they always pass it nancy and her cronies think that us voters are total morons
710877525,have you forgotten that the obamacare bill would create jobs almost immediately
710877525,they all rotate back to campus after their socialist theories fail in practice the list goes on and on
710877525,donations can be given at mittromney com because the nation can not withstand anymore of the special kind of crazy that is liberalism pass the republican's jobs bills and get out of the economy's way it can right itself perfectly fine without the democrat's meddling and manipulation an economy doesn't grow because you take cash out of its revenue flow place more rules and restrictions for doing business and demonizing its very existence for personal political gain
710877525,um the us federal government is the largest employer job creator on the earth both directly military teachers fbi cia border patrol home land security tsa etc and indirectly highways infrasctructure militray contracts subsidies and tax policy so again how is that you believe that the government does not create jobs

710877525,so again how is that you believe that the government does not create jobs you ignored the critical point productive productive productive how much profit does the military make that can be taxed other than taking money back you just gave them in salary tax the military not the companies the government take tax money to pay how much profit do teachers make teachers not professors how much profit do the fbi cia etc make a better way to get it but you wont understand but i will try if you take a way all the public jobs what happens to your examples can they survive without the money they take from jobs so economics wise they are not the same you can call them the same but that does not make it so nothing you listed is a productive job that can earn money that will pay taxes and is sustainable once the tax base real jobs is gone those other jobs go too or rather the freedom of the people who do them go fdr extended the crisis care to hear what fdr said himself august fdr appoints senator hugo black to the supreme court hiding that he is a kkk man june fdr rejects integration of the military which woodrow wilson started take a look at the paintings of the us revolution women men blacks and such fought together till wilson segregated it and continued till he was gone it was fdr that created the american form of gulag and internment he locked up japanese and germans by executive order wall street journalhow government prolonged the depression policies that decreased competition in product and labor markets were especially destructive the new deal is widely perceived to have ended the great depression and this has led many to support a new new deal to address the current crisis but the facts do not support the perception that fdr's policies shortened the depression or that similar policies will pull our nation out of its current economic downturn even comparing hours worked at the end of s to those at the beginning of fdr's presidency doesn't paint a picture of recovery total hours worked per adult in remained about below their level compared to a decline of in and it wasn't just work that remained scarce during the new deal per capita consumption did not recover at all remaining below its trend level throughout the new deal and per capita nonresidential investment averaged about below trend the great depression clearly continued long after fdr took office nobel laureate robert lucas and leonard rapping calculated on the basis of just expansionary federal reserve policy that the economy should have been back to normal by so what stopped a blockbuster recovery from ever starting the new deal only leftists who don't care about the trillion in unfunded liability for those programs would claim that it was a success even more so as it got us to go to war with the two largest socialist countries germany and russia

710877525,good call it's real hard to avoid believing that too many leaders in corporate america are putting their feet on the brake pedal and not the gas pedal in hopes that president obama will be defeated in november by poor economic numbers american companies have trillion in cash on hand why aren't they investing that money to create jobs and boost economic growth more comments on my blog barley literate by rick
710877525,nope we see at as more proof that obama is a failure i guess the left sees it as more voters
710877525,wall street journal government cannot create sustainable jobs useful jobs don't exist until producers discover them from the perspective of smith and ricardo real jobs emerge in the context of patterns of sustainable specialization and trade how are jobs created for keynesians job creation is simple entrepreneurs have knowledge of how and what to produce all that is required is more demand in order to induce them to undertake more hiring but their mistake is that the entrepreneurs only have knowlege of what to produce by who is paying so the whole keynesian thing breaks down the minute that the demanders demand stupid stuff arbitrarily ie they have no way to choose what is viable and their having money and needing a plaec to dump it dosnt give them that as its not driven by need necessity is the mother of invention fake necessity makes for fake needs being met like dollar hammers and highways that dont go anywhere trains that are not viable amtrak anyone etc in contrast in our smith ricardo story the knowledge of how and what to produce has to be discovered entrepreneurs have to figure out ways to utilize resources that satisfy wants in an efficient way the market mechanism first must undertake trial and error to create production processes that exploit comparative advantage until these new patterns of sustainable specialization and trade are discovered there are no job slots the problem is that you dont hear about the failures that sacrifived their own lives and money you only hear of the winners and then want their success to be tapped for someone elses benefit but if you want to see what the government can do see bankrupt amtrck bankrupt post office which is a federal monopoly ie they cant make money even when the state forced no compeition in first class mail thats how bad a monopoly cant break even care to talk about all the other bankrupt programs if they produced they woudl have extra capital at the end of the day but they are a drain not a producer the word sustainable in patterns of sustainable specialization and trade refers to profitability patterns that are profitable can be sustained patterns that are not profitable must eventually be shut down that is the problem with patterns of trade created by government borrowing and spending they are not sustainable as has been illustrated in the u s by the failure of many of the green energy companies supported by president obama's stimulus package moreover as european policy makers have discovered there are limits to how much governments can borrow to fund their experimentations in specialization and trade
710877525,tax increase in the rich do not create jobs either dumb arse dims are so dang dumb

710877525,obama cut taxes on individuals and small businesses and those 'job creators' still aren't creating a lot of jobs it's pretty clear when the rich have trillions in the bank that more tax cuts won't get them to invest it maybe taxing some of the rich will get them to invest what we need right now is a minimum wage increase and passing the senate transportation bill are the house republican leaders up to that or are they just political obstructionists
710877525,now come on nancy which is it is it bush that's responsible fot the bleak jobs report is it the tranportation bill could it not be obozo afterall both he biden and that tower of intellect wasserman schultz have said that the democrats own this economy at what point do you think that they will assume the responsibility for both the ups and the downs do you see that coming soon should i hold my breath huh

710877525,i am totally amazed that it is now and again the fault of the gop why because they are obstructionists why do they never realize that when they won't vote or pass a bill it is in the best interest of the country but when the gop does it it is obstructionism when the gop won't compromise aka completely agree with all of the liberal programs the gop is the bad guy they never say anything about the idiot harry reid when he won't even bring bills up for a vote when they have cleared the house i sure hope the american electorate at large sees the self centered egomaniacal un yielding morons for what the liberals really are

710877525,uh did miz nancy say something important here i get distracted watching those over sized phony pearls of hers jaggling around that turkey neck and end up missing what pearls of wisdom drop from her mouth
710877525,this speaks to what type of country we are turning into you mean to tell me that there is a jobs bill passed by the senate that's in the house and republicans won't even bring it to the floor for a vote are you kidding me experience has nothing to do with this nor can you blame the president this cluster republican house has blinders on they are so determined to obama out of office they figure they re at the point that you say screw the people we re to close to getting him out of office to worry about them as a result we re the ones that are suffering for it they already know that if they were to pass this bill the unemployment rate would go down significantly by november but what do you suppose they want to do they want to wait to see if they can get romney elected then pass a bill that should have been passed months ago the sad thing is that this isn't about liberal policies it's about the powerful wanting more for all you in here that claim that liberal policies are to blame for our current situation explain to me why the republican house will not pass a bill the will create thousands of jobs right away it's not like are infrastructure doesn't need repair and don't use the excuse about spending as this house won't approve anything for spending added to that this president has the lowest spending total of the last ten presidents if they don't pass these types of common sense legislation but instead wait to see if romney is elected to pass them we are in trouble it means that we've given up our voice in this country and the people like you who agree with them are solely responsible for it
710877525,i didn't say there wasn't any value in wall street and big business people i did say they should not be allowed to buy elections and disrespect democracy
710877525,does your contention explain the economy in spain or is it in fact the case that for every government job you cite one or more private sector jobs are lost
710877525,i posted this on bloomberg awhile back and i am so tired of leftists who foolishly believe that government is going to give them free things including employment that i am pasting my response to the original question which was have government regulations and taxation made it harder to run your business and hire people no question government makes it much harder for us and i say that as someone who started my software engineering company in we are a subchapter s corp which means that business income flows onto your personal return hence no ez in addition we pay amortized business personal property which means that if you buy a computer or a printer you can't simply deduct it you can only deduct a small part of it each year the federal government basically declared war on contractors and tried to force everyone into a w rather than category by creating a labyrinthine checklist which is used by the irs during audits and if you screw up the back taxes and penalties for fica will absolutely knock you out of business or more on the total amount of back taxes in addition to interest of around per year because of this you end up hiring a company like paychex to handle payroll and it basically means one less employee you are hit with cobra liability fica unemployment insurance you have to file w s w s i s s schedule k and many many other forms for both federal and state governments and as the owner you can only deduct of your own health care costs but the most devastating requirement on small business and self employed as well is that we have to file estimated quarterly taxes based on last quarters income which means if you have a good first quarter you have to pay the government the same amount in the second quarter even if you made absolutely no income and then try to float loans long enough to make payroll until you get your refund it is a ridiculous system
710877525,name a time in history when they helped it you cant
710877525,i sense chaos in the ranks of the demoncrats the leftist media none of their lies are working
710877525,as usual incorrect post war spending was fueled by marshall plan purchases from europe during reconstruction keynesianism does not work ask spain or did you miss the bond crisis
710877525,lets see blame it on congress blame it on bush blame it on everyone except the one that is the blame obama congress has passed over job bills that he told reid in the senate not to bring them up because he was going to veto them put the blame where it should be obama and show him the door out november if you do you will be called racists but obama won in with the blessings of the caucasians but he will not take the blame for the mess and look what he is doing to the democrat party he is destroying it after two years ago have super majorities in both houses and telling the republicans to shut up and sit in the back of the bus for the ride
710877525,simply go to recovery gov and view the poor job creation stats by state from the stimulus just look at ca ny il to start you have a lot of opinions but no facts you think a bill gets passed and magically 's of thousands of jobs appear doesn't happen that way in reality appropriations bidding process etc all consume significant time all these infrastructure jobs go to unions due to an executive order obama signed when first coming into office costs now increase significantly and the private companies get shafted as do women and minority owned companies that's the reality of liberal policies
710877525,samuel masters you are drinking the cool aid the house has passed over job bills and obama told reid not to bring them up in the senate because he was going to veto them and he did not want that know to the citizens of this country wake up this president is destorying our country
710877525,as usual the demo's blame the gop why they do not have a clue blame is all they can do and with the idiot in the wh why not try and deflect by the way nancy get a life
710877525,and maybe nancy harry can be the tar
710877525,i see you are no different than obama both lacking any knowledge on economic issues i will school you on a quick economic lesson first and foremost the government does not create wealth without wealth there are no jobs created so you and obama's philosophy of needing jobs bill are irrelevant what we need is to take obama's foot of the people's throat with his imposed regulations pending taxes and allow the people the ability to create wealth and the jobs will follow i think you need to listen to clinton gov cory and even deval patrick coming out against the attacks on free market enterprise and bain capital subsequently endorsing romney with their remarks the blame is where it should be squarely on obama and his failed economic policies
710877525,the gop made the job outlook poor like a spoon and fork made rosie o fat she needs to look in the mirror to see the cause of the job outlook looking so bad but i suppose she'd go broke replacing mirrors
710877525,then should they be allowed to participate in the revolving door of politics which is one of the primary forms of soft bribery used to influence policy
710877525,in january the biggest tax increase in history will happen we will be paying through the nose for obamacare so jobs and people are leaving states such as california michigan and new york the reason no company can afford to be in states whose tax burden is high to begin with and than add in to that the burden of the cost of obamacare next one is buying anything because they don't know if they will have a job next year or next month so just like the people the stock market does not like uncertainty we are trillion in debt add to that ssi the prescription drug program medicare and soon obamacare you wonder why investors are skittish than there are a growing number of states that are beginning to realize they can't afford to pay for all the promises that were made twenty five years ago now look at the union contracts and the promises that were made for pensions health care benefits etc and with each passing year the amount of money that is required grows yet the money that the states to take in to pay for this largess continues to decline this because people and business's are leaving these union states for right to work states so each party wants to blame the other party this solves nothing we are watching a train wreck in slow motion neither side want to accept responsibility for this mess yet they created it as always success has many fathers but failure is an orphan the american people have always risen to the challenge they have always stood behind their leaders leaders like lincoln roosevelt kennedy reagan the ship of state has a rudder it has a bridge an engine but there is no captain what we have on the bridge is a bunch of people who want to be captain but don't want the responsibility of being captain because in the final analysis no one want the buck to stop at them
710877525,we need to pass it so we can find out what's in it does anyone take that idiot seriously
710877525,so why arent a few democrats voting to bring these bills to the floor for debate the senate has the ability then to make changes to those bills that will then go back to the house to either approve or vote it down reid and the democrats are not even bringing the bills for debate they are the true obstructionists
710877525,no pelosi and others screwing around with healthcare rather than promoting jobs
710877525,if you read what the party of no says it always comes back to the keystone pipeline in which only provides a few temporary jobs for americans most of the jobs will be canadian even after it is built and now with that new student loan proposal which is a joke the party of no has said nothing but no to jobs creations their main goal is to keep president obama from being re elected to a nd term even if it means destroying the economy further the president can only do so much and the teathuglican house will do nothing but try to hack the middle class which is almost extinct
710877525,it has not been enacted yet and if you had any knowledge what so ever you would realize without the healthcare act the deficit will increase more before you spout off you need to educate your simpleton mind a little and by the way willard does not have a clue on how to run anything
710877525,hardly what this proves is the state of the economy was worse off then anyone had thought what bushy did was get this country into a depression with his unpaid for wars and who knows what else obama
710877525,what house bills are you talking about what a joke if there are house bills why have not the details emerged for us to read what a joke obama
710877525,get some sense to you women we need to rebuild our infastucture obama
710877525,this story begs the question pelosi what the f ck did you do the first two years when you were in power obama preaches accountablity but you people are f cking pathetic you take no accountability for the mess you put us in pelosi reid chris dodd barney frank and company are responsible for our financial mess for the most part had they done something other than fillibuster regulation of fannie and freddie starting in we would not be here right now but these liberal losers thought everyone should have a house even if you had no income that is not the way it works dumb a s s if you cannot afford it you rent and they have the gall to blame everyone but themselves there was blame to go around from clinton and rubin bush pelosi reid dodd frank to the federal reserve and yes even the banks but the banks can only play within the rules they are given when you strip down the walls between banks and brokerage houses then force them to make risky loans what the hell do you think will happen subprime lending adjustable rate mortgages mortgage backed securities collaterlized debt obligations mark to market and credit default swaps the government allowed the banks to take big risks and they ran with it the government told them to take the risk of low income loans so they took an even bigger risk in trading mortgages only made possible by the repeal of glass steagull and ho hum nancy harry and barrack blame someone else where is the accountability you a holes
710877525,easy there in the truth too much at one time will not only get the libertirds panties in a wad their heads will also explode
710877525,you rant like a beyotch too bad for you that it has no substance
710877525,exactly while the liberals were too busy injecting themselves into every aspect of our lives with that piece of schitt health care bill and every thing they've ever wanted to ram down our throats they did that the first two years when they had the majority of both houses no longtime jobs plan none nada nothing zilch all thy wanted is to take billions from the tax payers so obama could redistribute the wealth to his wealthy friends and force an unconstitutional bill down the that of working americans a bill that once it became known what was in it nancy piglosi no one likes it even if it did pass the smell test it is schitt for two years they had all the power they needed what did they do i don't know can't find anything still researching that one the only visible thing they did was in addition to creating more entitlements was to steal billions of dollars under the pretense of keeping unemployment under and it hasn't been that low since time for these fruitcakes to go bury are the leeches that is sucking the life out of this nation
710877525,what else can we expect from an empty suit that has been campaigning for five straight years he has yet to stop
710877525,hey nancy it does not work anymore stop the blame game stuff do some real work nancy and then retire to looney tune california
710877525,it does not work anymore brainless
710877525,she said a few days ago that the healthcare law would pass scotus because she knows the constitution lmao riiiiiiiiiiight nancy you didn't know what was in the healthcare bill but you know the constitution now that is funny as schitt right there i don't care who you are
710877525,the house republicans passed jobs bill in the house and they are on harry reid's desk harry pass the bills stop playing politics as for pelosi she is a pathological liar
710877525,the joke is obama took the job he took the job he made promises he had two full years of ramming crap down our throats and what if anything did he accomplish in those two years that actually has helped the economy create jobs and i don't mean creating government jobs they do not count because they require a taxpayer to pay for them obama should have never been president a part time state senator a part time u s senator a community organizer a less than stellar law professor a man who smoked drugs and drank through most of his college days a man who stated his only executive experience was running the school newspaper the harvard law review that made him qualified didn't it well what obama knows shows and instead of manning up and taking the blame he runs like away and blames others the man who said he would be accoutable and transparent not hardly by the way how does anyone really know obama is the smartest man in the room unlike past presidents he has sealed his college records at occidental columbia and harvard anyone curious as to why obama took the job obama was briefed on the state of the economy by his economic team roemer goolsbee voelker geithner orzag mark zandi larry summers how did they not know giethner was at the new york fed when our government was inflating the housing bubble he had a front seat it is amazing now that they didn't know how bad it was that is a load of bull if i ever heard one they knew but what they didn't know was how to fix it because none of these academics ran a business and had no working knowledge of how our economy worked they were great at lecturing us but as worthless as tits on a boar when it came to creating practical solutions and obama does anyone realizes we have not had a leader of this country for almost four long years if we did this would have been over long ago with layoffs staring obama in the face every day people losing jobs businesses going under homes being lost unemployment sky rocketing what did the smartest man in the room do he pranced around telling people to shut up and sit down because he won they proceeded to spend almost years on a strict partisan health care bill that more than half the country hates and wants repealed how smart is that how smart to waste the time on health care knowing that he needed desperately to put people back to work because they pay taxes and if people are unemployed you are not taking in revenue the government is going broke by the second how anyone believed this guy was the smartest man in the room is beyond me a man that never held a job outside the government a man that has never finished anything he began a man that abicated leadeship to others a man who didn't even know himself where he was born how he was ever allowed to be president is a mystery mccain was a disaster but hillary clinton was a lot more presidential the obama could ever hope to be
710877525,wall street and big business people have advice to give and there is a place for some of that advice are you trying to get me to stay that wall street and big business people should be banned from having roles in government that would also be un democratic i believe in having a system that treats everyone fairly
710877525,the american people will not vote for betrayal pass the transportation bill republicans fiddle while millions suffer holding out for koch keystone when the new route won't be approved for months obama
710877525,couldn't be the terrible leadership in the white house got to be someone elses fault b rock has been stimulating the economy with dollar hair cuts it is easy to see why he can relate to us poor folk
710877525,uou msn up weasel you condone public betrayal by republicans when the country is in crisis then you are equally guilty of treason

710877525,well they have to blame anybody but themselves their whole ideology is based on being a victim
710877525,if dems could not lie they would have nothing to say the worst economy since the great depression even breaking many records once held by the great depression but the highest priority of the demwit party is to get their kenyan witch doctor back into the oval office to my mind that is a clear declaration of war if the election does not end the greatest act of constitutional treason in us history there will be but one option left war
710877525,here here samuel and for you ron the government's job is not to create wealth it's job is to stimulate a faltering economy but republicans in congress are unwilling to pass even an infrastructure bill because it would give jobs to thousands of americans who with their earnings would spend money on things like say food which would give the grocery store manager an excuse to hire more workers to provide the food and that would show the american people that the larger the stimulus the bigger the jump start to the economy the government is not a household it's responsibilities are not the same as a household if you wish to compare the government to a household budget however we can do that anyone who has a mortgage does not have a balanced family budget sometimes it is necessary to borrow and sometimes it is necessary for the huge power of the federal government to be used to stimulate a faltering economy
710877525,what in the world are you talking about there are long term unemployed because of the lack of government investment into re training programs tax cuts for the wealthy don't create jobs bush tax cuts were in place since through the whole bust and subsequent rebuilding of the economy on the other hand obama cut taxes on of the entire population to stimulate the economy by giving a little money back to people who will actually spend it but putting the rates back only on those making at least k per year is viewed as a tax increase up really is down i guess i'm all for the somewhat regulated it was never free market that the us has always had and people can create wealth all they want but if there isn't anyone to buy the product there will be no wealth creation and if you put all of the money at the top you will not stimulate anything aside from political donations as an example that someone wrote recently if you distribute m to the wealthiest people in the us they each get m to buy one tv set each if that and put k away to invest if on the other hand you distribute m to million of the least wealthiest people they go out and buy million tvs or something else and stimulate the economy times more consumer purchases stimulate the economy so put it in the hands of those who will spend it the market will innovate its way around any regulations designed to improve both of our lives and the long term system changes obama is putting in place will pay dividends long after this election cycle we're all talking about long term health care costs over decades well guess what obama tackled first i get all of this and if romney was man enough to admit that any of it was a good idea in the long run i would actually take him seriously as a candidate
710877525,p s ron if you want to school someone in economics looks like you need to take a refresher course first
710877525,hey ever heard of europe they've got a little something going on over there
710877525,they have passed jobs bills with amendments attached like repeal social security closer eye billv
710877525,newt gingrich was the first to take filibustering to this level during clinton's presidency democrats know perfectly well about the nuclear option
710877525,your insurance premiums max out of pocket and co pays have skyrocketed because the biggest part of obamacare doesn't even go into effect until at which time you will likely be subsidized for your ridiculous premium the only entity large enough to change the structure of the delivery of healthcare in this country and therefore the price is the federal government were they not involved in the collective bargaining that is medicare you would be paying the original price you are charged not the diminished price charged to and accepted by your insurance
710877525,it does not work because you are unwilling to pay close enough attention to what is actually going on in your country bob
710877525,since the far right has spent upwards of million reviling nancy pelosi it worked on you nathan nancy pelosi is in actuality one of the most effective compassionate talented public servants ever to go to washington and when you start receiving your subsidies to help pay for your ridiculously priced premiums you can thank nancy pelosi
710877525,closer eye astrophysics you still have much to learn before you understand the way the senate works
710877525,absolute horse pucky astrophysics
710877525,the middle class creates jobs when the middle class can afford to buy things the economy is stimulated a wealthy person can only buy say cars that stimulates nothing but a thriving middle class can buy thousands of vehicles there is nothing wrong with being wealthy but if you have gained wealth in america you owe america your fair chair of taxes people who borrow money to create an idea a good or a service create jobs when money is not available to borrow those jobs are put on hold stop dissing government make government better vote for the party in favor of making government efficient and responsible not the party that gets itself elected for the sole purpose ot making government look bad
710877525,before you decided to school anyone in economics ron i would have to suggest a refresher course please
710877525,we've had a foretaste of obamacare in ma in fact it was modeled on romneycare our insurance premiums have increased faster than anywhere else emergency room use which was supposed to decrease drastically has increased by non citizens were not supposed to be covered but as of several weeks ago they must be people who do pay for insurance have seen enormous increases in co pays and deductibles and are thus reluctant to see their doctors even for annual visits and the system has had to be bailed out with federal money though obamacare has not fully kicked in yet the fact remains that employers and individuals are afraid of it and this is adversely affecting hiring and personal spending here in ma we were told just a few weeks ago that premiums would be decreasing and then a few days later we my family learned that ours was increasing by we are seeing even further cuts in covered services and we have had to opt for a more restrictive hmo which is costing far more than our more comprehensive plan cost us last year if you believe that obamacare will decrease the deficit and improve the economy you're the one who's a simpleton
710877525,federal job training programs are a joke train people for a job they already had train people for a job they could never fulfill increase federal employees which means increased benefits etc a joke total joke
710877525,the dems should have brought this bill to the floor years ago not that shovel ready joke they played on the trade unions now they expect the gop to play ball
710877525,the democrats do not have a clear majority with the current rules of the senate a clear majority requires votes before any bill is ever brought to a vote there are members of the democratic caucus including two independents who caucus with the dems if republicans are anything they are consistent and they have prevented nearly every bill from coming to a vote since obama took office because they got themselves elected for the sole purpose of making government look bad in every way it is their only success in being inept they are masters
710877525,we can not afford to hire unions to tear up the roads for more yrs and do nothing we are broke peeeelosi

710877525,hey nitwit no legislation is always better that bad legislation
710877525,if it wasn't for raising taxes on something or someone the dems would have nothing that is except for blaming others for their own failings
710877525,poor frankp he's caught between telling us that he knew all along that his savior obo the clown was a warmonger and suggesting to us without facts that romney may do the same
710877525,hey they cant buy products unless they have jobs you have it bass ackwards there genius the government cannot create any jobs that are meaningful the government has to borrow money to try to create jobs the last time obama did that he was an abject failure remember the stimulus and the shovel ready jobs get real obama and the democrats have done everything in their power to see to it that our economy stays in the tank no legislation is always better than bad legislation
710877525,lies and more lies riiiiight its a conspiracy to keep the usa down get real clown no legislation is always better than bad legislation we do not need to keep repeating the same b s and expecting a different result not going to happen we need some adults in charge everywhere not just the house
710877525,if obama reid and pelosi cared a whit for this nation and its future they would do the right thing and step down business owners won't make a move with this triumvirate of marxists in power because of the uncertainties of obamacare threats of higher taxes and onerous regulations by overreaching bureaucrats they will wait it out until november and i don't blame them
710877525,is it too painful for you to admit you were abjectly wrong about obama
710877525,democrats are funny
710877525,and jobs
710877525,nancy always has shovel ready plans always always ok
710877525,the only difference between rising healthcare rates now and with bush is that they are being spoken of out loud no one in the bush administration said one word about the high cost they were going up every year under his watch he proposed health saving accounts the gop congress under the leader ship of the hammer gave a billion dollar to the pharmaceuticals with out it being paid for even if the supreme court knocks down the law you have to give the president credit for at least trying to attack a system that has been a problem long before he got there and he did say that was what he intended to do the only other president to even try was another democrat by the name of bill clinton and the republicans treated his wife the same way some treated jesus and the other problem for the republicans but they have not yet figured out how to put a spin on and that problem is milt romney and the president healthcare are identical so how is romney going to spin that maybe he will come up with something else outrageous to say like he did with the auto industry romney is put in a position of of disowning one of the few things in life that he did was good he did something to help people and guess what it is working over of people in mass have healthcare because of what he did he should be proud but he can't because of misguided tea party nuts the other thing he should be proud of that he can't boast of is his religion why you might ask the answer is the same as the other misguided tea party nuts and what really brings a smile to my face is most republicans don't trust this guy hell most peole don't even like his phony butt but you guys are stuck with him good luck with that because you are going to need a lot of luck to pull this off
710877525,i see and your one of those business owners i bet what a bunch of parroted non sense any business that waits gets steam rolled no business waits for these idiots in washington to act simply parroted non sense

710877525,she doesn't care what happens anymore before she became the house majority speaker her net wort was million when she left it her net worth was over million seems like her and hairy set up a nice little scheme while americans suffered through obama failed policies
710877525,how do you account for all the other so called jobs bills sent to the senate where the are stacked on harry reids desk if it's obstructionists your looking for you need only look at the senate controlled by the democrats under the fine leadership of reid
710877525,great stuff but it's wasted on guys like that who cannot admit the failures of the progressives they have drank the kool aid and can't put the glass down till someone like bloomberg in ny outlaws the sugar content government does not create jobs it is there to foster an environment for people to prosper where they will create jobs in the progressive mind that would be those shameful companies like big oil big pharma and those no good wealthy people
710877525,you must teach at the fools school of economic failure and denial what part of we tried that b s and it didn't work can you not grasp please list the regulations that have been implemented under this administration that have cause your wealthy phantom job creators to not do ther duty

710877525,we are still under the bush tax cuts and dodd frank has not been funded your theory has sadly already been proven wrong your solutions have proven to be devastating in eurpoe if we raised taxes we would not always have to borrow money if we raise capitol gains to a higher rate than earned income the wealthy might invest in things that create job growth but they don't do anything unless they increase their bottom line that is why they have outsourced jobs to countries that allow their workers to be exploited for very little wages not because they are solid patriotic americans but because they want more money we give them tax advantages and they either rathole the money spend it creating jobs over seas or gamble it on wall street none of these things creates jobs here and it is so sad to see people continue to make this lame arguement
710877525,we have totally lost control of the election process by allowing the establishment to use the vote machines they are equipped with powerful two way modems they are programmable the elite can elect anyone they want you all can not do one thing about it without a general uprising

710877525,tell that democratic american way story to republicans in the senate who have unconstitutionally required a sixty vote majority for all legislation the founders did not intend for minority rule and we should not reward them for their bad behavior
710877525,obstructionism ask reid why legislation from the house of representatives continues to sit inactive on his desk ask pelosi the brain dead socialist of the democratic party why everything she suggest is toward obama's socialist agenda if there is any obstructionism it is the democrat's who refuse to allow jobs energy economic vitality to be generated out of reids office and place upon the senate floor for an up or down vote reid and pelosi are smoking something that keeps them brain dead
710877525,i am so tired of the party of no blocking everything the president is trying to do we should demand that they refund the tax payers money for there last two years of political crap they have done nothing but hurt this country trying to make the president look bad

710877525,typical application of the obama political machine they have ruined the country and yet it has all been done by someone other than obam or reid or pelosi only good thing is that they will be held accountable in november and the rejection of this presidency will be loud and clear a failed government with a proven failed ideology of socialism is destined to be thrown on the dung heap of bad experiences in history forgotten egregious unable to accept responsibility for the failure will be forever written on their foreheads
710877525,pelosi is a socialist skank reid is a marxist moron and obama is the word i wanted to use can't be printed hint a zucked up brain dead socialist puppet for the two mentioned above vote them out and if that does not work charge them with treason for not defending the constitution
710877525,another marxist zombie perhaps a socialist union thug
710877525,they shipped jobs because they don't want to pay wages or benefits you can blame the unions but the truth is until you are willing to work for a chinese wage or we nail them with import taxes they won't be back they just want to make profits off the u s without contributing and that has nothing to do with unions it has everything to do with greed and to heck with anything else
710877525,another marxist zombie perhaps a socialist union thug

710884191,who cares about atpa atpa is pennys for the ecuador people
710884191,just who is violating international obligations here chevron has been ordered by courts in the united states as well as ecuador to pay the people of the amazon region pf ecuador billion dollars and they refuse to it shame on the us government to even listen to this propaganda
710884191,chevron asked that the lawsuit be moved from us courts to ecuador chevron asked that an independent expert be appointed by the court to determine liability chevron agreed to abide by the decsion of the ecuadorean courts the trial was moved the expert chevron wanted was hired chevron never paid their part of his fees because they didn't like what he said the decsions were handed down and now chevron has tried every stall and dirty trick they can to keep from paying for the damage to the ecuadorian people that they are responsible for now chevron is using their clout to try to negate anti drug programs paid for by the us because it benefits some ecuadorians chevrons actions are a black eye to america and our foreign policy throughout central and south america the us made bp clean up its mess in the gulf chevron should clean up its mess in ecuador

710887728,wah wah wahhhhhh
710887728,my favorite cia spies in china will always be the dalai lama and julia child the dalai lama is often recognized as the highest paid and longest lived spy the americans have hired and julia child i never thought her cooking was that good guess the cia can do wonders for those in their service in their retirement lol
710887728,so in other words hundreds of chinese spies caught in the u s that have stolen millions of top secret military and corporate ideas and strategies and our spy that collects political gossip
710887728,please educate us what spies have been proven in court to be hired by the chinese government and been convicted of such in the usa of being state sponsored spies in the usa for the chinese government
710899434,obama would be in a better postion had he fought for a larger stimulus as was advised by many economists nevertheless we are much better off now than we would be if obama had used the romney ryan austerity plan we woud be in the middle of another great depression romney may be a cagey vulture capitalist be he has no idea about how to direct a national economy for the benefit of all the people romney has not made one single proposal of merit for improving the job situation maybe he is hoping to get some ideas from the donald
710899434,your a certifiable idiot with your words
710899434,hint when the finanical collapse comes all million will be ruined if a subset of that is slightly affected its not any worse then every single person
710899434,this from mr rape pillage and plunder
710899434,your right wing rants posted today make me laugh obama has done more to restore our economy and deal with the recession and restore balance to our government than these folks can ever admit and he's done it in spite of their obsructionism bush and cronies created this mess and they have fought the pres since day one as he works to fix it in order to be a republican you have to have no memory an ability to rewrite history willingness to twist and distort fact no place for logic in your thought process if all else fails resort to lies and personal attacks remember facts and reason have no bearing on our opinions
710899434,who is sheriff joe and who cares what he has to say
710899434,speaking of facts care to back up any of your assertions with some only the most delusional kool aid drinker could sit there with a straight face and say obama's policies are turning our country around done more to restore our economy you mean like sitting on the columbia and south korea free trade agreements until the outcry was so great he had to sign them is that the type of doing more' that you're referring to or how about the keystone pipeline that he still won't approve you are a delusional fool
710899434,funny anyone with a brain that's been paying attention would consider this a harsh indictment of the republican obstructionism in congress
710899434,sorry libs you can continue prevaricating to your heart's content we are no longer eating the dog food
710899434,who are you and who cares what you have to say putz
710899434,it's obama's fault it's his economy
710899434,mitt sounds goofy when he blames barack for lack of jobs isn't he aware the gop congress has been and still is bent on suppressing consumer demand how can you sell your labor when nobody has the money to pay for it
710899434,thank goodness americans have a proven business leader to take our nation on a path to prosperity energy independence and full employment soon we will be able to say president romney romney
710899434,indeed the president has done everything he possibly could to fix the economic devastation the republicans created no matter he tried however the republicans have obstructed and obfuscated his policies this economy belongs to the republicans they should stand aside and let the president fix it
710899434,what planet delivers your newspaper
710899434,oh jeff seems you missed your psych meds today you're spouting nonsense again claiming obama has a clue now go peacefully and take your nap jeff sigh liberals so sad
710899434,i think what themob meant was turning the country upside down
710899434,socialism and suffocating nanny state regulations don't create an environment for private sector job growth who knew ummmmmm actually i knew gf yourself joe and truthdoctor are one and the same it's a fun fact
710899434,john that make no sense whatsoever
710899434,keynesian economics has been as discredited as your college shitbrick
710899434,yes unrestrained socialism and regulation is just what the economy needs you are either a retard or a liar either way shut your yap
710899434,the economy tanked and unemployment increased when republican policies were implemented to reduce taxes for the rich to eliminate regulation of the financial industry and they ran up the deficit with unfunded wars now romney wants to fix the economy by reducing taxes for the rich eliminating more regulations and increasing the deficit with an unfunded iranian war is there anything wrong with this picture
710899434,you mean the way the democrats stand aside when republicans are in power you are an idiot joey
710899434,which public sector union do you work for nothing else explains your idiocy
710899434,obama has done more to restore our economy and deal with the recession and restore balance to our government than these folks can ever admit appreciate the humor thanks jeff
710899434,mr willard romney the critical question is do you deny you were th in job creation in the nation when you were governor yes or no you want to compare apple and oranges instead of comparing just oranges as they existed then with other states you can't be serious attempting to compare a recession economy that obama inherited with the economy when you were governor be honest for once with the american people
710899434,this is great news the more losers that wind up unemployed the better if the lazy among us need to lose their job to ensure bo is out who cares
710899434,it sure is a good thing when democracy has been privatized bought and sold obama
710899434,he seems pretty happy that unemployment is up
710899434,he likes to fire people remember why wouldn't he be happy about poor employment numbers
710899434,the failure has been the partisan way that our government has been operating the blame cannot be throne onto one branch if a party conforms strictly to its base is unwilling to compromise solely to keep legislation from being enacted their only intention is to make things worst
710899434,government data last year found that percent of people under age with a bachelor s degree about million people were unemployed or underemployed it is the highest percentage in more than a decade reflecting just how far the economy is from recovery today's slow economic growth is a disaster for those unemployed and underemployed as they look for jobs when so few new jobs are being created for younger americans as a group this is a particularly acute issue nearly one in three young adults in the workforce are not now able to gain full time job experience this not only hurts them temporarily but deprives them of the experience they need to get a better job in the future it also deprives u s companies of the skilled and experienced workers they will need for their businesses to prosper in the years ahead
710899434,he only likes to fire lazy losers ie democrats
710899434,yeah thats what the public union thugs have been doing with our tax money
710899434,so much for a voice of reason from the tea party
710899434,and what will mitt do other than tax cuts for the rich
710899434,gone fishing don't waste your time with facts repubs and teaers hate facts too much fox
710899434,yeah that unemployment during the bush terror was just awful wasn't it lmao
710899434,mitt makes a lot of sense if you were a business and you had to deal with the added cost of complying with new regulation new taxes for obamacare a potentially higher tax rate from expiring bush tax cuts the uncertainty of currency instability brought about by record deficit spending and money printing etc etc then it is any wonder that any private sector hiring is going on at all to the extent there is a receovery it is happening despite the head winds of obama's policies not because of them if you were an individual and you were uncertain about your job or thought you'd have to pay higher expenses in taxes then you would be less inclined to hire someone to remodel your kitchen the net result is lower economic activity and this is multipies across the country i had a lot of hope when obama was elected because of the things he said about making spending cuts and getting the country's financial house in order he had the clout to do some bold things but missed his chance the obama adminstration's view that the secret to a robust economy is to raise taxes on the wealthy and expand government and regulation is unfortunately just buffoonery
710899434,you dems have screwed things up so bad you've put us in battlefield triage nobody wants unemployment to go up but if unemployment goes up a little and that keeps obama out of the office so the dems don't put us over a cliff for sure then it's for the greater good besides doesn't that mean more victims and people on government benefits anyways your brilliant master plan congratulions left you've done it the nations choices are now lose little or lose big what national stewardship failed party failed president all stemming from their failed and whortless ideology good riddance
710899434,hey everybody sees what a dnc troll posts so that they can say look look mean tea party lol nice try sam oh excuse me dr sam
710899434,yes i'm sure people being able to keep more of the money they earned rightful through work is the problem you dems for being as educated as you brag about for being the party of higher intellect that you co about just cannot seem to understand basic math those taxes would amount to a tenth of a percent difference which would be negligible wanna see things turn around cut your god damn endless entailment spending that's the problem always has been and always will
710899434,your lack of intelligence is made embarrassingly obvious by the puerile and vacuous nature of your comments as your kids might say get a life
710899434,tax cuts for the rich work every time they're tried
710899434,really ask pres reagan pres g h bush g w bush how lowering taxes creates jobs or how raising taxes means less revenue
710899434,you mean letting them keep more of the money that they earn since taxing it won't solve any problems or have any benefit other then stealing form those to make those that don't and are jealous feel good
710899434,for the rich
710899434,if the legislation is raise taxes spend more create healthcare the repubs shouldn't budge that is the problem and why were in this mess
710899434,looks like you and jfrankmo dropped out of the same high school
710899434,and don't forget sam and dr sam
710899434,here is some honesty nurse sam decent americans don't want a marxist community agitator in the white house got it
710899434,the economy will boom and the rising tide will lift all boats stop axing dumb questions
710899434,i'm not delusional but understand basic math gaining even k jobs is better than losing k k per month we lost million jobs from mid to q obama has helped and the only argument you have against that is that it would have been better without his help and you have nothing to base it on this recession is not like the last few why because people could still get loans easily to start businesses they could use their credit cards to start businesses or bail themselves out they could take money out of their homes to start businesses or get through a rough patch all three of those options are either not available or much more limited this time around the small business boom that normally helps pulls us out is severely restricted by the fact that people can't use the sources they've always used in the past to finance their businesses it's not rules and regulations they can't get any credit either from the banks their friends and family that are under water or their credit cards whose limits have been cut hey i get that people want it to be better but if i'm treading water and some's approaching slowly in a crappy boat to pull me out i'm not going to argue that i was better off when there were weights tied to my feet and the waves were crashing over my head
710899434,funny i didnt mention the any party names if that is your take on the problem you have razors edge veiw
710899434,like obama has done with wall street the banksters you love to hate the one your party while running behind your own constituents backs placed more of them in the treasury fed and other key economic positions then ever before in the history of the us yea keep preaching were not your dumb constituents we watch what comes out of the other side of your mouth or face
710899434,we're digging out of a very deep hole earnest said no earnest they're digging in the wrong direction we're almost to china now advise them to put down the shovel and step away from the machine we'll all be better off
710899434,and eli and bella the gender confusion is a fun extra
710899434,actually for all of us as the s s s late s clinton's capital gains tax cut and s showed but don't let facts get in the way of your faith
710899434,for the economy
710899434,apparently romney is not aware that rebublicans in the house have purposely and quite effectively quashed any kind obama democrat sponsored jobs or infrastructure investment legislation since they got control of the house in their treasonous effort to destroy the economy to prevent obama's re election in november thanks mitch mcconnell eric cantor paul ryan and the rest of the gop thugs and of course you know who the victims are again as usual you and me your grand parents and your kids and what is left of the middle class working stiffs
710899434,didn't a businessman lead us into this in the first place
710899434,stull kevin you forget that it was the years of the republican adminstration that is responsible for the increase in regulation today obama has been stripping it away stop listening to fox and watch the news instead
710899434,explain what happened when pres reagan lowered taxes the nation lost jobs explain when pres g w bush lowered taxes it did nothing for jobs or the economy
710899434,well then it's time for them for the young to vote out the republican house that have been blocking any jobs infrastructure legislation and are intent on doubling the interest rates on your current future school debt
710899434,no actually that was pelosi and reid when they took over the congress in concert with their freinds frank dodd obama shumer and other commies
710899434,so how is more years of obama getting nothing done going to be good for america why not elect someone who can work well with others if you think the communist dems will be in control of the house and senate then that is the result of public school education how come bill clinton thrived with a republican newt led house and senate and obama is inept
710899434,buuuuuuuushhhhh diiiiiiiiid iiiiiiiiiiiit did you think in the only excuse you would have for obama would be bush did it i did
710899434,road to recovery from the gop stock market now doubled and the job loss handed obama for one month january
710899434,you progressives need to get back in your hole the adults are busy fixing this mess
710899434,i don't accept your premise so no
710899434,before markets opened friday the labor department reported that the economy added just jobs in may well below expectations of to make matters worse the government also revised down figures for job gains in march and april as it found the economy actually added fewer jobs during that time than it previously calculated so not only this month but the previous and this is only a continuation of the 'trend' jeff
710899434,that is responsible for the increase in regulation today obama has been stripping it away ha ha ha that i've got to pick as my 'quote of the day' jeff
710899434,here where mitt romney and i in san diego we do not like trade unions and support lower wages for workers and prefer to push the medical costs of employees on to the tax payer lower wages for workers makes more profit for the wealthy here we have huge gatherings of homeless families who live in tent villages on the side of freeway off ramps we are starting to have a lot of problems in our homeless camps these people can not afford to pay local property taxes to support city services so they are forming their own security forces and violence is erupting among the women and children white and black who live in these camps we sure are glad the republicans might care enough to send a surveillance drone over the american tent cities
710899434,by the way read the choke 'healthcare' bill if you're interested in 'added regulations' it's a veritable cornucopia' of regulations jeff
710899434,explain what happened when pres reagan lowered taxes the nation lost jobs gee musta been that the guy in the same office years before must have 'left things in worse shape than it was originally thought' that 'explanation' work 'cuz it's the one being used now jeff
710899434,yes i'm sure people being able to keep more of the money they earned rightful through work is the problem you dems for being as educated as you brag about for being the party of higher intellect that you co about just cannot seem to understand basic math if i may i think it's more than 'basic math' 'some' appear not to understand the 'individual freedom' that allows people to prosper not 'enrich their neighbor' through their own efforts hint it's one of the reasons that this country was founded on and has since mostly prospered another reason could be termed as 'escape from an oppressive gov't' look around jeff
710899434,and restore balance to our government than these folks can ever admit see 'executive orders' jeff
710899434,i just hope that romney doesn't support marco rubio's misnamed dream act amnesty that would amnesty millions of illegal aliens
710899434,who is sheriff joe and who cares what he has to say joe arpaio sheriff in arizona one who doesn't care what the 'feds' say but for the most part is interested in enforcing laws as they exist today personally i can't say the same for the 'justice dept' et al jeff
710899434,me too
710899434,no a faggot did barney frank
710899434,what new direction mr romney same one adopted by gw which changed unemployment from to
710899434,jobs report is 'harsh indictment' of romknees business practices maybe tax breaks for outsourcing good paying jobs to be done by communist slaves and right to work for less wages have undermined the american workers ability to purchase anything but food to feed their family as the corporations sit on trillions of communist sweatshop profits as the american worker goes bankrupt maybe the american voter will finally learn the truth about the marriage between the republican't and the corporate boardroom
710899434,the republican'ts are about corporate profits the democans are for middle class wages
710899434,the bush led his company into bankruptcy and then became rich off insider trading an investigation that stopped on conveniently then he bankrupt the country but only the middle class and the poor and republican'ts don't think either of those two groups important to their goals of domination
710899434,while you are in china can you bring back all the jobs that the republican't tax laws and free trade sent there
710899434,the president's policies and his handling of the economy has been dealt a harsh indictment this morning romney said wrong dufus republican obstructionism since day one of the obama presidency is the reason the economy is not completely fixed their destruction of the economy in order to take obama out is right on schedule lousy gop bottom feeding pond scum
710899434,it's bush's fault it's bush's depression and it's the republican't filibuster that is bankrupting our economy
710899434,anyone that votes for anti american republican terrorists and hostage taking thugs is voting against their own best interest and the interest of their families you morons keep those gopigs in power so they can continue to destroy the country the rest of us love
710899434,just by the empty headed rants about economic issues that you learned from fox and limbaugh just shows you picked the right occupation as a nameless karl rove lobbyist whose mindless drivel equals the minimum wage that karl pays you
710899434,you mean delaying republican't trade deals that hurt the american worker and incentivised corporate outsourcing and the veto of a pipeline to outsource our unprocessed crude oil to china it seems as all you republican'ts are out to strip mine america and leave the american people with a jobless wasteland
710899434,manufacturing gaining for the first time in decades in the u s that's not humor that's changing red corporate republican't outsourcing trends and laws that were invented by karl rove and grover renquist to destroy the unions and high american wages
710899434,the prez isn't supposed to direct the economy he's supposed to create an environment that's conducive to economic expansion and job growth obama's doing the opposite especially with his healthcare labor and tax policies which he will ensure go up in jan
710899434,bush had to deal with that stuff too quit blaming everyone else its always the leaders fault he's had his time and its only gotten worse how quickly you forget the supermajority
710899434,we aren't outsourcing our oil its canada's oil being piped to us they are paying the whole tab you have no brain and no sense we are taking canada's jobs with the pipeline
710899434,we lost those jobs because obama didn't do anything he did his heathcare with his supermajority and lost all those jobs obamacare was and jobs were last he could have passed tax hikes a budget anything he wanted can't go back now and say it was repubs fault he did nothing he won't even have his prized healthcare when its all done
710899434,so you work hard and no one else does and you work so hard that you don't think you should pay taxes that's good to know
710899434,so if the bad job numbers are the result of republican obstructionism then the whole recession is the democrat's fault because they controlled congress and obstructed bush democrats have fixed nothing and will not fix anything because their policies are backward having no clue but to print more money and accept no responsibility while dodging basic duties like producing a budget are not examples by which any intelligent person would believe as evidence of coherent policy the public is reminded once again how clueless democrats are at building a free society and a capitalist system
710899434,statisticians revised downward their earlier estimates of job growth for march and april shaving those estimates by and respectively it means job growth in april was not but and march was not the numbers for may is frightening with only now knowing that we need a minimum of new jobs just to stay at our current unemployment rate and if we went from at the end of febuary and dropped to at the end of march and we dropped to at the end of april but we returned to because may was a disappointing new jobs shouldn't we add those decreases in march and april back to the base line and add another because april was nearly as bad as may and therefore we really should be at unemployment i mean just asking or can the obama administration just scrub a few more workers from the employment rolls to realign the revision
710899434,if i had a dog he would look like cisco
710899434,uh sounds like maybe romney forgot that his economic plan led to losing jobs a month
710899434,i consider the jobs report a harsh indictment of of the republican congress can we do something other than engage in political wiener fights
710899434,so the liberals were not involved really what about when they had both houses of congress instead of trying to fix the problem then they instead asked each member of their party for their eternal wish and then they put it all into one bill called obamacare nothing about jobs nothing about stopping their drunken spending sprees nothing but regulating every aspect of our lives with the exception of putting people to work and it's an indictment on the gop you really need some new sources rhenone you have now sux
710899434,in sounds like you forgot who has been driving this rig and who has been riding in the back
710899434,don't bother with the meds they won't someone delusional like you just head right for the wacko hospital you'll feel better sometime i guess
710899434,exactly the liberals took over the senate in and put a halt to gws 'straight weeks of positive job gains they weren't gonna go for an of hat positive stuff so they put the brakes on it
710899434,i voted republican the last time and the american killing anti american accessory to murder race dividing class warfare mongering liberal domestic terrorist still got elected we now know that affirmative action does not work especially for incompetent anti american radical islamist jihad loving sympathizer named barack obama we can end this useless act it brings nothing but complete misery and destruction upon the entire nation
710899434,which one of obama's economic wonders are you referring the stimulus money to the teacher union pensions the corrupt green energy scandals or the soon to be defeated obama care trillions in annual debt and its associated compounding interest proposed by obama has repeatedly gone down with the help of dems bottom line you are an idiot

710899434,america has a better chance on electing a man who has created jobs and become wealthy doing it than electing a man whose only talent is community organizing which is a 'polite' word for shaking down or blackmailing much like the mob does when it gets its protection from its victims community organizers such as obama went into businesses and threatened them unless they submitted to their demands obama threatened businesses with the tag of racists how do you prove you havent been racist how do you prove a negative a lie matter of fact barry obama has been shakin down america since he got into office all kinds of czars all kinds of unconstitutional laws and getting away with it because anyone daring to criticise him would be branded racist by the ministry of information better know as the main stream media it is time for the community organizer to go the infant in the white house has failed miserably unless of course this was his original intent in the first place the utter destruction of america truth is stranger than fiction
710899434,my god did you think obama could snap his fingers and do away with the closest thing to the great depression give me a break you really don't want to go back there do you
710899434,if you could look at all the requests for money to congress sitting in secretary of state clinton's possession very few are for a solution to american problems such as jobs unemployment for blacks has been for years and was finally reported to be at what did the president do what positive idea for jobs did he have for all people the hispanics have the next highest unemployment remember this lie i will focus like a laser on jobs people want jobs jobs jobs jobs jobs jobs president obama's focus is on his job only as he flies all over campaigning a leader is a problem solver not a whiner
710899434,if adding k jobs a month is grave failure what does romney feel about bush policies which he wants to repeat which gave us loss of k job a month
710899434,obamam accuses romney of expanding government hahahahahahah
710899434,make excuses for obama shows your soft bigotry of low expectations for a black man
710899434,obama you should not expect anything really from a black democrat

710899434,the president likes to point to the million jobs created since he became president though million people remain unemployed may's new jobs and downward adjustments for march and april mean the economy has averaged just jobs a month over the past two months that's half of what's needed simply to keep up with population growth and is a dramatic drop from the jobs created per month in the january march quarter
710899434,the right wing rants posted today make me laugh obama has done more to restore our economy and deal with the recession and restore balance to our government than these folks can ever admit and he's done it in spite of their obsructionism bush and cronies created this mess and they have fought the pres since day one as he works to fix it in order to be a republican you have to have no memory an ability to rewrite history willingness to twist and distort fact no place for logic in your thought process if all else fails resort to lies and personal attacks remember facts and reason have no bearing on our opinions read posts above and below rest my case

710905034,this is what happens when you have illegals voting and wanting more free healthcare and foodstamps
710905034,and we will be watching a not so slow motion train wreck in california when the democrats take total control of both houses in ca with the number of illegals in california pushing the social services to the brink it can only get worse as the legislature keeps on giving what they do not have and their solution to every problem is to keep raising taxes god forbid they choose to cut spending full speed ahead to the cliff of economic destruction like obama would like to do to the nation
710905034,vote out whichever candidates ignored the san onofre nuclear power plant being in such a concerning position look at this www sanonofresafety org
710905034,i'm revoking your invitation guest

710905034,illegals have never voted in california you sound so ignorant right now
710905034,san onofre and diablo canyon are shut down right now about mw offline as summer heats up yessiree nuke is the way to go we live a little upwind of diablo canyon have our chelating pills close and watch the news of the quake fault studies ever wonder why it's called diablo canyon
710914609,the promise of the deficit being cut in half before the end of obamas first term was another obama lie obama don't have no plan except to bankrupt america and bring her down a few notches
710914609,i would add we may have a spending problem but we also have a revenue problem this is why after all the bush tax cuts which promised to spur the economy vis a vis trickle down economics and a slashing of tax revenues failed to do anything aside from plunge us into our current recession the president has frequenty put forward plans to takcle the deficit most recently during the gop debt limit level hostage fiasco where he conceived and supported deep systemic cuts to entitlement programs that even leaders in his own party didn't support but has been rebuffed by republicans in congress who refuse to join onto any plan that includes increased revenues so rather than asking where the president's plan is mr zemek should ask the gop why they refuse to support any plan that includes increased revenues even though amazingly the last gop plan for 'growth' that failed to consider revenues the bush tax cuts plunged this country into the deepest recession mr zemek has ever seen
710914609,great post it amazes me that we are to pay for the wars and all of the other government expeditures with a tax structure that is the lowest it ever has been the wars alone are well into the trillions and the nation gets a tax cut we need revenues and perhaps mr zemek should start paying taxes that are needed to help our country survive we all need to pay more taxes above a certain level which should include corporations paying their share
710914609,i guess zemek didn't get the memo obama is too busy playing golf insulting our allies like poland and partying with hollywood billionaires to bother with trivial details like reducing the deficit
710914609,the socialist doesn't have one unless you count cloward piven
710914609,re obama worse than carter it really makes one wonder where the obama hatred comes from when you write ignorant comments like that obama's insulting poland meanwhile romney's reigniting the cold war with russia partying with hollywood billionaires i'm not sure you even know what that means but if you're concerned about links to billionaires you should reacquaint yourself with where all of romney's fundraising and superpac money is coming from playing golf huh what a red herring the bushes practically lived on a golf course you don't like obama because he's smarter than you because he's black because you're just selfish enough to care more about your federal income tax rate than all other issues combined fine we get it but please for your own sake stop writing stupid ignorant short memory hypocritical junk like the below on public blogs
710914609,blaming bush doesn't work anymore moron especially after years of record deficit keynesian spending and other failed policies of obama go take a course in econ and don't make a fool of yourself next time with another sophomoric post
710914609,the bankrupt new york times is not a credible source the only thing lost is logic and objectivity
710914609,perhaps obama should set an example and stop flying his barber to the wh x a month stop playing so much golf and stop attending fundraisers in one day right after a terrible jobs reports is released while we the people suffer through the worst recession since the great depression as the junior senator from illinois now president likes to constantly say
710914609,who got us into this worst recession since the great depression i know you don't want him blamed but it was bush starting in gave tax cuts for the wealthy during a war along with deregulations who didn't pay for the wars who spent million on an embassy lost billions in a deep hole that no one knows where it is allowed price gouging by oil companies guess who benefited from the war oil companies who took a surplus and gave us a deficit go buy a f'n fridge bush who got hank paulson on the tube demanding he needed billions in days good book out now telling how the banks squandered the money and your concern is that obama is playing golf or going to a fundraiser as if bush didn't do either probably didn't need fundraisers since some pricey oil companies had an iv hooked into him
710914609,bush is to blame moron obama has spent years doing mop up after this dip stick conservatives have to blame someone so they are blaming obama this is not obama's mess deregulations and tax cuts created most of it along with wars this country was on the breaking point and then you have people whinning they are paying too much in taxes they don't give a rip about the country only their pocket books if the house would have allowed funds for jobs we would not have these problems instead they made up false budgets tried to deregulate even more and acted like goons on halloween the oil spill can be blamed onto bush also no one checked what msm and big oil was doing except screwing each other perhaps a little oversight by president bush would not have allowed msm to be doing what they doing people died because of that along with billions of damage and how many died due to non existing wmd lies and liars
710914609,another in depth voter for the gop ya right
710914609,i forgot to mention that obama is also busy flying in his barber from chicago every weeks for a haircut no doubt while we suffer through the worst economy and job market since the great depression as obama constantly likes to remind us it's comforting to know that he has a nice haircut like his colleague and fellow democrat john edwards
710914609,i see the ignorant obama drones desperately trying to deflect attention from obama stunning record of failure the problem for you drones is that obama now has a record to run on or hide from that includes record number of long term unemployed months or more has shot up under obama with their ranks now at million record number of months with the u unemployment rate above despite obama promising that it would not go above if we passed his failed stimlus climbing u unemployment rate which is now nearly over of young american grads jobless or underemployed record number of americans on food stamps downgrade of the nation's debt record low gdp growth including an anemic rate in overall the gdp rate has climbed just between q and q the national debt up trillion under obama with record trillion annual deficits now the norm median household income is now below where it was in february sources cbo bls treasury department wall street journal ibd remember these facts the next time obama starts talking about free condoms while his discredited attorney general plays the race card again
710914609,what a stupid statement about bush's cuts which even obama praised and extended when it was politically expedient for him to do so bottom line if you you want another years just like the previous years big govt huge deficits no jobs racial divisions then by all means vote for obama
710914609,hey drone for all of his faults bush had the class to give up golf while we had troops fighting and dying overseas on the contrary no class obama still continues to play a record number of rounds of golf and attend fundraisers in one day right after a terrible jobs report is released but why do all you ignorant obama lemmings spout the same tired rachel maddow talking points it's obvious you have never taken a course in economics logic or critical thinking we all know obama wants this election to be about bush or free condoms but the suffering american people are not as stupid as obama and axelrod think they are this election is a referendum on barack obama and his failed policies
710914609,mr zemek and others are certainly entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts contrary to mr zemek's revisionist history a review of data from the white house office of management and budget shows that tax revenues did not consistently increase after the bush tax cuts went into effect in fy tax revenue in dollars was billion for fy the first budget of the bush administration which went into effect after president george w bush signed tax cuts into law in june revenue dropped to billion bush signed two more tax cuts into law over the next two years in fy revenue dropped further to billion about a percent reduction from two years earlier this drop in tax revenue occurred even as economic activity the nation's gdp was continually rising according to bureau of economic analysis data revenues did temporarily increase from billion in fy to billion in fy before sliding to billion in fy and then dropping further to billion in fy as the recession exploded analysis by citizens for tax justice claims that the bush era tax cuts resulted in billion in lower revenue from fy through fy and that the total cost if implementing the cuts including interest payments on debt was billion i'm sure mr zemek knew that given his concern for deficits laughably mr zemek's suggests that the recession was a result of months of newly established democratic congressional control not the previous years of economic mismanagment by the gop and bush ha ha mr zemek's smart enough to know that that's a preposterous claim economies and rececessions simply don't work that way and while we may have had a unemployment rate sometime in mr bush left office with the rate nearly double that i suppose that was nancy pelosi's fault too for the horatio alger ayn rand fan club president who questioned my credentials i have indeed taken econ courses in fact i have a masters degree in economics you keep worrying about golf and haircuts code for latent racism and stupifying ignorance i'll keep thinking about the real issues at hand
710914609,yes nearly all of these things are true and nearly all of them are the result of the deep recession that started under the last administration recessions and their impacts always take years to correct themselves and are almost always marked by high unemployment deeper deficit spending spikes in public assistance food stamps medicaid etc drops in income etc that's why we should learn from the mistakes that led to this recession not repeat them and why we should certainly not blame the guy who was handed the reigns after the wagon wheels had fallen off i'm not suggesting at all that obama has handled the recovery even close to prefectly but to deny that gop policies led to the current recession and the majority of the deficit is to simply ignore facts and well established economic patterns
710914609,thanks for pointing out the bush era tax cuts being a major factor in the recession we can not run a country in two wars without additional revenue
710914609,i mentioned that perhaps you should pay more in taxes as well as myself for the survival of the nation taxes are at their lowest and with nation building defense and wars expenditures are high surely you have write offs with children so you probably are not on the highest level of taxation no one accused you of not paying taxes pays all the taxes in which has become an urban myth of the poor own of the wealth and of the debt what are you going to tax them on according to bureau of labor only don't pay taxes of the top income own of the nation's wealth and take home of the national income should they not be paying on what they earn
710914609,if we had a flat tax it would treat us all equally at least in some fashion too bad the dems just can't get past the class warfare mantra i agree with the writer that it is unfortunate that president obama hasn't tried to bring real change and address social security and medicare
710914609,bush was off the job mainly on vacation in tx more than any president in the last years all while starting and fighting two wars and passing tax cuts that led to the current recessions so stop worrying about haircuts and golf in the end you don't really care about either if you did bush's lack of work ethic would have driven you crazy i have a hunch it didn't
710920164,bravo senator grassley for your stewardship of american talent thank you we the people
710920164,ther 'takin er jobs
710920164,grassley will end innovation in this country
710929490,until and unless bill clinton can expalin his comment i did not have sex with those wimmens he will not be a uniter or help defeat gov walker but he will remain slick willie to most
710929490,so the best the democrat could do is send in that washed up old philanderer slick willard jimmy carter must have been busy writing his latest anti semetic rant
710929490,the purpose of government is to bring people together not divide and conquer so bill have you shared that perspective with barak harry and nancy this campaign visit is below you just shows how bad you are doing in wis dems only make a pitch for working together when they are losing get used to it
710929490,bill clinton seems to leave a bad taste in peoples mouths at least that's what monica lewinsky told me
710929490,shame on you bil clinton walker's policies are working in wi and yet simply because of partisan politics seeks to wipe that out all in the name of unions shame on you for being a union shill first and american second
710929490,what a gamble if walker wins what does this say about the influence of lack of the ability to move an election from bill clinton
710929490,go back to your porn stars slick
710929490,and all the king's unions and all the king's slick willy surrogates couldn't put union thug power back together again go walker

710929490,former presidents should not behave like a partisan which is a discredit to the presidency then you may ask what do you expect from clinton who discredited the presidency when he was on that chair
710929490,read somewhere union membership is melting at a rapid rate since choice came to wi workers they seem to like the new arrangement also read that since the thugs have been stood up to business is doing better in wi read someplace else that since indiana became a right to work state employers are starting to invest in new facilities
710929490,dear slick we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america please go away again
710929490,homeland security needs to inform all women in wi to not bend over
710929490,bill clinton was unable to help his wife win the democratic nomination for president in bill clinton and barack obama were unable to help reyes in texas on tuesday and bill clinton will have little effect on the walker race nor will his efforts save the dnc and obama from further embarrassment after the loss
710929490,i completely agree this hypocrisy is very disappointing the divide and conquer philosophy is the benchmark of this radical progressive administration bill is advocating for big fat unsustainable government sorry bill wi simply can't afford it and they've seen the light have some respect for fiscally responsible voters it's their state and their future the public unions have chosen to become dead weight rather than team players they made their bed and now they don't want to lie in it
710929490,let's all pray that the people will use their common senses to keep walker in place dems lack commomn senses as you can tell by their socialist agenda by all of them in all areas of government go scott whip their butts
710929490,walker is toast and more than likely also going to trial under an additional investigation attacking hard working middle class american taxpayers who are union members in favor of rich donors who don't pay their taxes is not a way to govern
710929490,slick is just trying to keep the clinton name out in the public till he and hill can run for the white house again
710929490,i think you need to do more research and stop with the talking points
710929490,then why does every poll including gasp msnbc's show walker with between a point lead all the union vote fraud and ballot box stuffing in the world can't make up that big a difference and neither can a visit from slick willy
710929490,i'd like to hear what his definition of is is
710929490,go home bill you were removed from office and should of turned in your keys maybe you are still looking for a hummer in the white house halls since you have been removed from the oval office as i said go home you had your day let it go no one voted back in to any office

710929490,when walker wins i will be lmao
710929490,clinton and carter no class no respect for the office never shut up and the way a past president should act the office itself has dignity
710929490,don t be too hard on slick willy at least he endorsed romney today i don t believe slick has ever really liked barry because barry doesn t care about working folks or balancing the budget gov scott walker does care about balancing the budget and about working folks
710929490,i wonder if bill tagged any badger coeds while he was in town
710929490,why shouldn't they they're longer being forced by union gang bangers to fork over of their pay check to support the marxist union bosses it's no coincidence that all of the right to work states are booming economically in comparison to the union marsist run oligarchies
710929490,there's still time
710929490,crowd size
710929490,i suspect that the walker recall failure will actually help obama win wisconsin in november but if the national economy continues to recover at the same tepid pace obama will still lose to romney
710929490,clinton left the white house with approval higher than reagan you're a moron
710929490,hee hee this moron thinks clinton is implicated because he flew in a plane supposedly owned by some guy who was accused of sex with a minor lmao
710929490,clinton was never removed from office he serves two full terms a total of years and he left the white house with approval higher than reagan you're a moron and a liar
710929490,most women in wisconsin want to bend over for the rock star former president
710929490,clinton left the white house with approval higher than reagan that's twice the approval of your gay hero bush
710929490,barack harry and nancy can't nor should they bring us together with old racist fat women hating white homophobes like you
710929490,clinton left the white house with approval higher than reagan that's hella less washed up than your gay war criminal hero bush
710929490,dervrak monica lewinsky is an intelligent jewish babe who wouldn't give a old racist fat women hating white homophobe like you the time of day
710929490,bill clinton has no reason to unite with old racist fat women hating white homophobes like you and your gay war criminal hero bush
710929490,help save america kill all public unions and starve the taxpayer funded dem political machine

710929490,and still bagged your momma
710929490,anyone who thinks government is the problem for unregulated greed on wallstreet doesn't really understand what the problem is and certainly can not be considered in the conversation about fixing it until they can be brought up to speed repeal the gramm leach bliley act let the bush tax cuts expire tax capital gains at twice the rate of earned income and sit back and watch how quickly people start investing back into the economy
710929490,spoken like a true union hack i hope thepublic sector unions will finally be broken
710929490,can you come up with anything coherent stay in your mom's basement and shut the up disqus you are by far the stupidest person posting here

710929490,i always had respect for bill but lately i think he's acting like one big horses a of course he's doing this for his party and not for o bama boy but there comes a time for him to step away from the mic and its now bill looks like a fool and i never thought he would accomplish that
710929490,here is an idea if you are regestered as a republican you pay no taxes but get no benefit of the social safety net you can home school your children or we will charge you a tuition fee and when you drive on our streets and bridges you will have an r tag and can pay a toll for the use if your house catches fire put it out yourselves when you need the police or to go to the hospital we'll make you pay upfront when you get old or sick you will be left to your own devices keep in mind that the rest of us will have universal healthcare public education through college using state universities and social security and we will use the tolls and fees we charge you to supplement our tax revenues kinda like the privitization wolves would use them to fill their off shore bank accounts everybody is happy
710929490,respect for a two timing hypocrite wow i wonder how many more women he has had under his desk i have no respect for clinton people area always going on about how we were in such great shape when he left office why because clinton had to deal with a republican congress he couldn't do the things he wanted while he was president why does he wany hillary to run again so she can finish what obama has started thats why i tell the people of wisconsin hold firm stay strong and keep your governor walker he will fix your state lord help us all

710929490,the purpose of government is 'to bring people together' mr clinton you sure its not simply to keep law and order and protect its citizens from foreign powers mr bill grant you sir unity ought to be a sound byproduct of good gov't but not the purpose by your statement abraham lincoln then failed did he not not to divide and conquer you say then why the recall election at all sir doesn't that simply breed a precedent of more divisiveness in the populous via stubbornness aka if we unions don't get 'our way' through protest let's petition for a recall and how about those flea bag senators who divided the wisc senate months ago that was not divisiveness and obstruction sir when people are uncertain and afraid it s easy to get them confused and divided you say if walker had been in control there wouldn t be a constitution umm which executive are you refering to here wisconsin's or in the wh are you confused
710929490,scott walker delivered what bill clinton did not deliver in i e a middle class tax cut also gov walker has to his credit stood up to the head haunchos of the unions something which bill clinton did not do gov walker will probably be successful next week as the electorate of the badger state assesses his performance with respect to his promises gov walker is a man of his word bill clinton accordintg to his own attorney general janet reno is a liar she so stated when she was asked by a student at old dominion university in

710929490,clinton's previous opposition to recall elections in september back then clinton worried that tossing out gov gray davis d who had just been reelected the year prior would make california a laughingstock and would herald the beginning of a circus in america where we just throw people out as soon as they make a tough decision clinton nothing more than a publicity seeker who can't let go of the fact he is no longer president move on bill your time has come and gone
710929490,get higher education so you don't shovel that crap at the waffel house
710929490,and by that little stamp as guide you are neither young nor fit leaving your response moot and going by the candor typical of a post from you much is left to be desired for your focus and your capacity to argue with civil tenor
710929490,of course slick willy is there and why not remove a governor who is turning the state around fiscally who would want to live in a state that was finally getting out of hole and reducing their problems guess not the unions or the dems what a bunch of crap
710929490,democrats are worried big time to send bill up there i imagine bill has very hard feelings regarding obama knocking hillary out of the wh because of some under the table deals

710929490,bill never had any class that is an understatement why can't he just retire as an elder statesman however slimy and keep out of the mix like the more classy ex presidents of course carter does'nt count when if ever will the dems stop debasing public office

710929490,i really despise how the left has tarred the term wall street wall street is made up of all types of businesses most of whom balance their budgets pay out salaries and benefits and many who contribute to charities business does not have the power to tax and then proceed to waste our money on green energy projects gsa parties and god only knows how many more ways if you're talking unregulated greed there is nothing to compare with spendthrift government and their unsustainable debt
710929490,bubba will not be enough

710937228,using terms like safe is not accurate enough with the knowledge that we now have no checmical including water is completely safe and all chemicals including benzene are safe at acceptable levels to make matters more difficult some people may be more succeptable than others we should really use terms like lc or ld or some other dose related term rather than the generic safe or not safe

710949810,this really torkes me a do nothing congress collecting paychecks they will say they are home meeting the people and fundraising some don't even live in the state so when they say they are 'home' doesn't mean they are where their voters are congress needs to get their act together and start acting responsible no wonder people don't have respect for what they do since they don't do anything they are not respecting the voters they are not being responsible to their jobs

710949810,they spend more and more time re election fund raising and less time in session so pac money could fix that but only for one side if there must be pac money make it so its divided equally between candidates regardless of party and if not used goes back into the kitty another thing that gets me is trying to get a hold of them call the office there out in their districts call the district office not in do you want their voice mail no click they show up on the news after their gone contact them and most of the time you get a form letter that fits best your enquiry

710975881,which side of the aisles in the house and senate is blaming the other for the effect of sequestration on the new jobs report if big industry especially defense industry has begun layoffs because sequestration is looming who's to blame for the bipartisan budget stalemate that led to the sequestration law
710975881,bloat fraud and waste are the places to start and then with the royal life style of the military brass the defense industries don't seem to be suffering at all defense is not about workforce development specious argument it should be about next generation systems not obsolete th century approaches that the politicans seem to understand
710975881,fact trillion and counting obama has debt as far as the eye can see and everyone gets cut and taxed just to pay the intrest
710987338,maybe the morons in the house could vote to cut spending across the board except defense
710987338,that's it that is all they can come up with they are worse than the dems at least the dems are demanding everyone carry insurance so that people don't show up in the emergency room without insurance and the rest of us have to pay for it
710990060,the only one he needs to talk to is dead on arrival harry in the senate house has already passed a budget and taken care of panetta's concerns obama will sign anything that might get him re elected so he's no problem just harry
710990060,panetta thinks he is going to have a job after election
710990060,we need massive spending cuts at the dod and we need to replace this investment in training programs for returning veterans so they might get a chance to find a job some where instead of watching their family go homeless
710990060,the main problem with the usa firing the first shot heard around the world in cyber warfare is that whenever you attack another country in cyber warfare that country could hire computer geeks and counter attack this could get very expensive for home owners and on line businesses

710990060,if obama were a leader instead of imitating one by having his people release national security secrets he would step up back his secdef and get the problem solved we are in this failure because obama showed bad faith and backed out of a deal he had reached with boehner the president is playing politics with the lives of our men and women this is the most irresponsible glory hound of a president ever he is making us weaker and our enemies know it and will test us because of that weakness that is the real reset just look and see how from russia to pakistan we are snubbed and worse the paks won't open our supply lines soon to be exit lines and they throw a guy in jail who helped us find a mass killer a war criminal obama is a disgrace the men and women of the armed forces should not have to pay up front for his willful negligence
710990060,unacceptable how can this be after all the work that went into sequestration if the democrat senate and president want to kill it do it now both sides are beginning to like this political football

711000942,i am always happy when an term incumbent is going to lose
711000942,it is the kiss of death for obama to support anyone it is guaranteed to call attention to the fact that democrats that support obama's policies are not working for the tax payer but private and public unions illegal aliens and big gov't and unbearable debt levels
711000942,if i had a dog he would look like cisco

711000942,there is the kiss of death
711000942,i waffle on that sometimes i think so because if obama wins hillary's political career is over since biden would be the nominee years later while if romney wins hillary will run in at other times i think they are doing a political step trying to pander to moderate democrats and liberals at the same time in an attempt to hold together a fracturing party
711001357,quick more food stamps
711001357,krueger chairman of the council of economic advisers said the president inherited a weak economy that continues to hinder employment duh that was so years ago trillion dollars later we're no better off than when he took over somehow i believe if you gave this community organizer a decade he couldn't figure out what to do
711001357,everyday i hear about more jobs being sent to foreign sweatshops but the republican't won't vote to stop the tax incentives for outsourcing instead they promise a tax holiday on foreign sweatshop profits if corporations don't hire american workers until after the election economic terrorists all of them selling the american dream for a jet with a golden toilet so that they can dump their smelly load of bull on the american people
711001357,don't jobs numbers usually increase in may due to seasonal employment guess things are much worse than the ostriches known as obama co think they are
711001357,no doubt they need any job growth to heck with faster added and i'll bet at least twice that many jobs lost in may minimum yet another month of negative job growth and there is no excuse for it november can't come soon enough
711001357,oh really let's have the name of just one 'sweatshop' and one job that was sent there and the name of who sent it there oh you can't provide any such information i guess you shouldn't have wasted your time posting complete fabrication then
711001357,duh that is an understatement wake up and smell the coffee the latest job growth is very sad this president is killing jobs not creating jobs why do people lie like this krueger guy i would get rid of him if he were my advisor this guy also thinks the economy is good well i hate to tell him this but he is dead wrong stop inflating things to make this president look good it is all lies ask the people out there who are all out of work i have four friends who have recently lost their jobs pathetic situation i do not lie about these things
711001357,maybe monthly but they revised the previous months lower by jobs for april alone does three months a trend make
711001357,obama's job's committee chair immelt opened a plant in china just as he was making a joke about shovel ready jobs not being shovel ready as one flagrant example
711001357,auserity is killing jobs you twit had obama not fired k of public sector employees to please those that would never be satisfied there would be a lot more spending vs saving you conservatards are beyond thick
711001357,boerner and republic do want help so we need to stop pay tax and we need to stop pay boehner

711018784,can we say that the epa is in my opinion that are a bloated agency who should be cut in size plus what makes lisa jackson qualified
711018784,affimative action
711018784,over the years i have seen that most gop complaints about the epa that had no substance it has always been politically motivated
711018784,same old senators this week a great american firesale on jobs in the usa they are proposing that every single foreign student in any usa college now get a permanent green card so when one out of every two american college graduates cannot find a job their 'leaders are selling american citizenship and jobs for personal profit leaders lamar alexander jon cornyn charles schumer joe lieberman john mccain lindsey graham and you know it marco rubio usa job seller supreme he is just a baby senator and already in on this racket
711018784,jackson can take the position that the supreme court ruling has no effect on the epa continueing to operate as usual because the holder doj along with obama has ruled that they are to be simply ignored when court rulings come down it is still the policy to curcify them in dealing with citizens and healh and welfare will always take presidence over any matter that indicates rule of law has been violated epa is obama hammer for radical environmentalism and environmental terror it is the only terrorist agency in america that is government sponsored and congress doesn't have the back bone to drive a stake through the blood suckers heart

711028403,it is really sick that a president sits around deciding who will live and who will die morally wrong on every level
711028403,healthcare reform bye bye obozocare bye bye death panels
711028403,we noticed the same thing at work if you are a special american you must ignore their flaws and lack of judgment war is always better operated by liberals no one in the media complains or is concerned about the numbers of dead or cost
711028403,he's not a hawk he just doesn't have the courage required to declare war and go capture someone who can actually give you intelligence info anyone can kill remotely it takes no courage no real thought and you can say your hands are clean people need to understand that this man is a coward
711028403,obama hopes to get elected on the backs of the terrorists he sure won't get re elected on the outcome of his economics which is an undeclared war of terrorism on the nation's consumers
711028403,correction obama the chicken hawk

711028403,and don't forget the 'without due process' jeff
711028403,no that is what bush did fear war and terror plots
711050684,lol after four years this is the best he can offer the economy will improve obama's only hope is an orwellian twisting of facts in other words the big lies must come out recently an online blogger tried to make the argument that this administration has not increased spending by blaming bush for all the budget increases passed after obama's inauguration and jared bernstein a cheerleader for progressives said raising taxes does not lower revenue as proven by art laffer or inhibit businesses proven by plain old common sense if this economy is honestly assessed obama is finished he cannot run on or from its performance his only chance is therefore to convince us that the facts are wrong shame on the people of this country if they buy into this travesty of truth
711050684,this is just more evidence that obungler's socialist economic policies have failed there is no spinning this for the soros monkeys obama sure fundamentally transformed our nation into spain next stop greece
711050684,the bailouts and all the government spending have done absolutely nothing but extend the inevitable hold onto your hats people the real recession is right around the corner when will they learn you can't spend yourself out of a hole
711050684,things have gotten better the former aide said that s the bottom line what planet does the person that made this statement live on obviously not earth
711050684,choom gang economics ain't working
711050684,obama is a disaster as president this is what happens when people deceived by hope and change elect a community agitator to be president this moron obama does not have a clue about economics and has no idea how to govern god help us
711050684,it is a little scary said one former white house official there s no sugarcoating this one so they are finally admitting that their is no real recovery and they with their accomplices at the bureau of labor and the liberal media have been sugarcoating the economic numbers for the last few months
711050684,how the heck is a may jobs report a game changer for a november election if the august september and october jobs reports are good and gas prices are stable does anyone honestly believe that voters are going to say yeah but i remember the may and june numbers were bad so never mind the good winter and good fall my vote's for the spring numbers it's a long election let's not try to end it early for either side we'll just get it wrong
711050684,anyone want to lay odds that the rate will tick up for a few months then suddenly drop for a miracle recovery because it s not like the government is grading itself oh wait
711050684,obama and left just doesn't get it the economy is not going to grow at great rates as long as the private sector is not sure of the near future when obama is writing regulations by the bucket load going around congress when obama wants to add trillions more to the national debt with no spending cuts when dims add tax increase to every peice of legislation they write when obama doesn't acknowledge the ss and medicare mess when all obama has ever cared about is re election this economy will never approve even the slightlest review of how clinton was re elected to a second term besides having a weak opponent was he followed conservative principles more than of the time republican congress back thna forced his hand and they made a stable predictable future for business to grow
711050684,agree with you completely the american people are sick and tired of this incompetent clown obama and are ready to boot him out in
711050684,may k new jobs average bush month k new jobs late ' and early ' massive job losses ' slow job gains is that good no is that better than the recession of course on what planet this one
711050684,an alinskyite radical like obama is good at campaigning but good at nothing else the mess that this country is in now is proof of that
711050684,but one former white house aide said it s a minor blip on what the white house and the campaign see as a broader picture it's clear that they don't get it and intend to keep digging our hole deeper expect them to start playing with the numbers again their ideology will not allow them to give ground or compromise they'll just point fingers and whine like a four year old while we swirl the fiscal toilet bowl
711050684,the jobs created last month were created in the united states of america when mr romney creates jobs they are outsourced to foreign countries and not kept in this one
711050684,well said i prefer the good abe to the bad marxist abe

711050684,is obama going to stop playing so much golf and flying his barber to the white house twice a month at our expense he parties while we suffer
711050684,you republicans are using the same tactics the democrats used on george w bush you are trying to paint him as stupid when in reality like w barack is actually quit intelligent he just plays dumb because like bush they are just letting goldman sachs and the fed and the aipac owned military industrial complex get away with murder and they know it
711050684,loongest period of unemployment months since and lowest labor participation rate since
711050684,are you better off now than you were years ago
711050684,she lives on another planet like the rest of her liberal friends so out touch
711050684,the more unemployment the better most of the unemployed are worthless lazy losers who mooch off of productive taxpayers these mooches are democrats and obama supporters ironic that these lazy people will cost bo the election and romney will take over who doesn't like lazy unemployed democrats
711050684,seriously based on all these headlines you'd have thought jobs were lost helloo if the obama team can't manage to diffuse this alarmist spin he needs a new team as for mr romney until he's been where the president is now he should shut up and count himself lucky that no one is counting how many jobs were lost during his bain years hey obama team that might be something you should explore
711050684,last time i looked home depot staples whole foods had stores opened here do you know something i don't however solyandra and fisker and a few other energy companies don't have jobs in the us they went bankrupt after getting taxpayer loans approved by obama and chu
711050684,there goes recovery summer again
711050684,when he should have been focusing on the economy he was playing with windmills and solar panels now the chickens are coming home to roost
711050684,the jobs number should be going up not down and the summer months are usually not great
711050684,you must have your head stuffed so far up your back side that your brain is getting an insufficient supply of needed oxygen to function coherently you lost liberal moron
711050684,i give up i don't know why i voted for obama i guess i am a very stupid person please like below if you agree that i am very stupid

711050684,romney will win in a landslide
711050684,romney created more jobs than lost he helped create home depot whole foods staples to name a few all thriving businesses and obama helped with taxpayer money solyandra fisker both of which are bankrupt with our money romney spent his investors money and his own
711050684,it's congress' fault right now they're the ones who are obstructing the recovery
711050684,five more months of this obama fraud kicking his tush out of office is the only thing that will help america
711050684,i'm shocked shocked that with all those folks graduating from college there were not any 'green' jobs waiting for them speaking of college i figured out why president obama has not released any of his college transcripts his dog ate them
711050684,the flailing fading obamunist
711050684,speaking to a crowd at the honeywell plant obama vows to get all of the other job seekers to quit looking and then the unemployent rate will be or to continue to blame george bush for obama's ineptitute obama the pbr prezy
711050684,don't forget first solar
711050684,my lord you are a dumb bore what union are you in commie
711050684,there s no sugarcoating this one another former administration official called it an 'oh s t' moment gee you think 'somebody' might finally be 'getting the idea' considering it's 'politicians' prob'ly not jeff
711050684,just a guess a lot lower i moved my k from stocks to bonds a while back then watched the market head up i held in bonds now thinking it may be been a 'slightly' better choice jeff
711050684,so what does our failed president do he goes fund raising
711050684,as for mr romney until he's been where the president is now he should shut up and count himself lucky no problem all he has to do is 'blame obama' for the first years since that's 'worked so well' chuckling jeff
711050684,i thought he ate his dog
711050684,anyone want to bet that former aide is axelrod a tried and true propagandist goebbels would have liked davey except maybe his greasy hair and dandruff from article look we obviously wanted a bigger number but it s a continuum it s not a snapshot the former aide said but if we would ve had today s numbers in people would ve been thrilled things have gotten better the former aide said that s the bottom line
711050684,well turn about is fair play
711050684,yeah team hire sue duh that's the ticket
711050684,wake up reid and the democrat controlled senate have not offered a budget bill in years obama's budget didn't receive a single vote not one democrat voted for it the house has passed numerous job and spending bills these talking points aren't working
711050684,gee boss if only more of our competitors go of business we'll be in clover in over our head but in clover
711050684,wanna bet obama's economic team is grateful they've exited the sinking ship who would want this attached to their career should be interesting to watch the old time democrats silently step away from obama several notable already are does this have anything to do with chickens and coming home to roost
711050684,well let 'em eat cake
711050684,forward romney s election
711050684,joe steel after the final tally of votes for the month of may it has been determined that you will receive the may useful idiot award you can put it along side your many others congratulations joejoe take a bow
711050684,things are looking dim so what does are dimwit pres do why he goes to fund raisers today looks like the only job obama is worried about is his
711050684,no that was someone elses question i thought muslims found dog to be unclean doesn't look like this jerk can stay true to anything or anybody november cannot come too soon for me
711050684,depressed over five thousand years ago moses said to the children of israel pick up your shovels mount your asses and camels and i will lead you to the promised land nearly years ago when welfare was introduced roosevelt said lay down your shovels sit on your asses and light up a camel this is the promised land today congress has stolen your shovel taxed your asses raised the price of camels and mortgaged the promised land i was so depressed last night thinking about the economy the wars lost jobs savings social security retirement funds etc i called a suicide hotline i had to press for english i was connected to a call center in pakistan i told them i was suicidal they got excited and asked if i could drive a truck folks we're up the creek emailed by a friend rudy haugeneder
711050684,ya think
711050684,doesn't look like it he has fundraisers today looks like the only job obama is worried about is his
711050684,this is crazy the republicans will twist anything to make obama look bad the economic problem is far too complex to blame on one man also you have to factor in what is happening ion europe are we doomed to this negative campaigning until next november is there any way to silence republicans
711050684,so much for the claims of democrats that their recession ended months ago and that we are well on our way to recovery the facts are different and the facts are that obama not knowing anything about a free economy has no understanding of that which is necessary for the gummit to do to nurse it back to robust health so he blames republicans once again blames the congress once again' blames bush once again blames everyone but the real person responsible for the lack of recovery obama and the crew of know nothings about business and or capitalism but are staunch advocates of state sponsored businesses a fascist principle which didn't work for mussolini in italy in the 's 's and won't work for obama now
711050684,has that kool aid actually destroyed some of your brain cells you cannot possibly believe the crap you just posted frickin rome is burning nero is attending fundraisers and you're saying the situation is too complex my god man wake up
711050684,keep the spin mark and the dems will keep the checks coming stfu you lying pos you can bet the report will look better these next few months because the obama thugs will make them look better
711050684,end tax cuts exorbitant ceo compensation and government subsidies because they don't create jobs creating manufacturing and marketing superior products creates demand which creates jobs pushing crap on the american public and hiding the true price in a tax cut or susidy is a fraud on the tax payer and the consumer and ceos do not deserve huge compensation packages for ripping off all the stakeholders to show false profits and provide tax based dividends to shareholders this is not free market capitalism the is big business fleecing the american public plain and simple and it does not matter who the president is
711050684,all you have to factor in is that this sorry excuse for a president burdens america with too many regulations too much litigation too much unionization too much spending and excessively high taxes cut taxes cut spending cut regulations enact tort reform and defend the right to work with being forced into a union and the economy will grow without government tyranny holding it back and to answer your question no there is no way to silence the truth as much as you want to believe the lies and force people into ignorance the truth will never be silenced and the truth shall set you free
711050684,you must have your head stuffed so far up your back side that your brain is getting an insufficient supply of needed oxygen to function coherently my roomate's sister in law makes every hour on the laptop she has been without a job for eight months but last month her income was just working on the laptop for a few hours read more on this site x e
711050684,no we're not democrats tried to paint bush as dumb when he was not we don't try to paint obama as dumb he is not he is ignorant in many areas needed to be an effective president economics is one area he is not dumb he just doesn't know that he doesn't know and is making decisions based on false information that may be dumb but that doesn't mean that obama is not intelligent no one can know everything about everything but one who is well grounded and safe in his own skin has no trouble realizing that his knowledge of a given subject is lacking and that there is no disgrace to ask for guidance from those with more knowledge in the area in question astronomy for example or nuclear physics obama's problem is that he thinks he knows all there is to know about lets say astronomy but he doesn't and he makes decisions based on his incorrect belief that he knows all about astronomy and when we get squished by an incoming meteor which knowledgeable astronomers say we could have deflected and the us goes up in flames obama's reaction is to howl that it's all bush's fault the meteor was bigger than i had been led to believe or as george burns might have said say good night gracie to which gracie would reply goodnight george goodnight barry and goodbye
711050684,obama logic is to cancel unemployment insurance for more americans as this would cause the unemployed percentage numbers to go down even if the number of americans workers is actually higher because an individual not collecting unemployment insurance and not working is not counted as being a person
711050684,that's what all af rican dictators do you know that
711050684,it is a little scary said one former white house official there s no sugarcoating this one another former administration official called it an 'oh s t' moment eeeeewww this is gonna leave a skid mark in the undies prior to november
711050684,fact call it what it is nothing else unemployment is rising due to obama's policies
711050684,jobs report upends race really contemplative folks of all political persuasions seem to understand those job numbers are not completely reliable
711050684,the shoe shime boy doesn't care hey man i got mine get it
711050684,fact obama's dream is here and now cloward piven strategy is a political strategy outlined in by american sociologists and political activists richard cloward and frances fox piven b that called for overloading the u s public welfare system in order to precipitate a crisis that would lead to a replacement of the welfare system with a national system of a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty cloward and piven were a married couple who were both professors at the columbia university school of social work the strategy was formulated in a may article in left wing magazine the nation titled the weight of the poor a strategy to end poverty
711050684,i agree with you even if you don't have enough maturity or class to match wits with bleeding heart liberals
711050684,fact nice chart from maddow blog what a joke
711050684,fact troll economy stupid
711050684,obozo does not want people working for a living he needs them to be on welfare that's his voter base
711050684,amen thanks for saving my two typing fingers the trouble to sum this up it's not bush it's not europe it's not the house republicans it's just reality wheneven democrats are shocked you know they are worried twice as much as they express someone will and have already sugarcoated this but t obvious is obvious obama's plicies have failed liberals grow up and read the writing on the wall or at least listen to democrats jumping obama's ship
711050684,fact bush unemployment rate to for seven and one half years then obama gets elected unemployment then jumped to then as obama is sworn in it again uneployment jumps over so nathan you are a moron

711050684,little wonder why this guy is boss he is sharp you can't be any fairer than this leader dear employees as the ceo of this organization i have resigned myself to the fact that barrack obama is our president and that our taxes and government fees will increase in a big way to compensate for these increases our prices would have to increase by about but since we cannot increase our prices right now due to the dismal state of the economy we will have to lay off sixty of our employees instead this has really been bothering me since i believe we are family here and i didn't know how to choose who would have to go so this is what i did i walked through our parking lots and found sixty 'obama' bumper stickers on our employees' cars and have decided these folks will be the ones to let go i can't think of a more fair way to approach this problem they voted for change i gave it to them i will see the rest of you at the annual company picnic
711050684,a trillion dollars jobs bill and this is what we have to show for it i se the dow heading on down to under the unemployment rising back up and gas staying around the to mark here in california it is over four dollars a galleon now all president obama has to offer is an excuse and blame he does not see that is his leadership that is holding the economy back

711050684,yea like the elected law makers in mississippi thatjust switched to the gop
711050684,hope and change are slogans not plans forward is just another empty slogan
711050684,there is now no question that the american economy has been shredded by the forces of austerity the anti growth agenda of the republican party has killed millions of jobs an stalled the recovery we will not become prosperous again until these inept lawmakers are sent packing the american dream has been grievously wounded thanks to political pandering to the corporate elite and a disregard for the ordinary worker americans that drive our country www sunstateactivist org
711050684,word for me cause i don't like obamas plan of russia and china collecting the usa as their own look on the bright side at the very least your freedom to trash the very foundation that built this nation is still intact now thank a veteran whether you want to or not
711050684,i think all of his other internet aliases have won a few of those awards as well but joe why did you quit using jack is it because you like to use independent more hmm
711050684,you're correct those dems in the senate are blocking the republican budgets
711050684,obama is just another empty suit who benefitted from affirmative action well i guess now we can close out the experiment on affirmative action it does not work the experiment itself was a complete success but too bad obama and aa didn't pan out
711050684,loongest period of unemployment months since and lowest labor participation rate since
711050684,statisticians revised downward their earlier estimates of job growth for march and april shaving those estimates by and respectively it means job growth in april was not but and march was not the numbers for may is frightening with only now knowing that we need a minimum of new jobs just to stay at our current unemployment rate and if we went from at the end of febuary and dropped to at the end of march and we dropped to at the end of april but we returned to because may was a disappointing new jobs shouldn't we add those decreases in march and april back to the base line and add another because april was nearly as bad as may and therefore we really should be at unemployment i mean just asking or can the obama administration just scrub a few more workers from the employment rolls to realign the revision
711050684,austerity trillion in debt what austerity
711050684,all of this bad news and what's obama's response blame bush and attend fundraisers forward to the biggest gop beat down of a sitting democrat president in us history hope and change one and done

711050684,obozo regime is like a young salesperson who spends more time and mental energy coming up with excuses why they didn't write an order than actually going and hitting doors
711050684,only jobs were created in april not the reported and the unemployment dropped to it should now be adjusted to i have said all along the bls is making up fictional figures may only saw jobs the unemployment should be adjusted to to be accurate when you have no plan jobs are not created and million people are looking for work what happened to i will focus like a laser on jobs all the president does is campaign campaign campaign last year the economy grew at a snail's pace i bet it is worse now just as the president punted the mortgage crisis to congress he will do the same with the jobs crisis a leader has a vision and solves the nation's problems
711050684,and even abe has finally seen the light looking good there abe

711050684,that's okay signspeaker i'm starting to believe obama doesn't stand a chance i'm beginning to reget voting for him
711050684,gop has done nothing about jobs in the two years they have run the house they talk abortion and war and do nothing for the middle class jobless they blame the democrats but gop has done absolutely nothing it's one thing to have a plan that takes time to work but the gops only plan is to crush the economy to claim vistory they are truly the enemy of any american looking for a job they have given the wealthy trillions in tax breask that were supposed to create jobs and it hasn't happened but they blame democrats who have created jobs i hope the clueless voter has the memory to realize that the gop created this financial disaster and they have done zero to improve the lives of americns besides the mega wealthy it's evil at its best
711050684,this is the intelligent real honest abe unlike that knuckle dragging drooler the fascist liberal dishonest abe

711050684,huh ryan's gutting of social programs will surely improve the economy look at europe and their austerity programs unemployment and gdp growth that makes sense
711050684,more private sector jobs were added in may according to this bureau of labor statistics report that's an extra people who are gainfully employed what is so dismal about that
711050684,they've tried but hairy reed has blocked their bills and obama would veto them anyway you demokkkrats own failure your fascist party is a traitor to all real americans
711050684,more than half the deficits the last years are a function of lost tax revenue due to the loss of m jobs and higher social program costs p add unfunded wars and athe medicare drug program and very little of the deficit is obama's
711050684,all your social programs are failures ss and medicare are ponzi schemes when are you going to get a clue that socialism doesn't work

711050684,lol really clueless poster nice try though
711050684,leadership are you serious he cannot stay on the porch long enough to get his teeth into any kind of meaningful work congress has bills up the wazoo waiting for action but oblamer cannot bring himself to do the hard work of getting dirty harry reid to bring the senate into the fray and get something substantive done bloviating is his forte these days and he isn't even good at that what a damn loser what the hell does he thing we pay him for this bozo is totally devoid of leadership it is time his paycheck bounces
711050684,lower than when obama got elected oppps
711050684,obama has not been relaible either
711050684,hot damn now there is a great idea
711050684,the austerity in europe was never implemented they put that off till and will probably not implement it they did raise taxes which of course killed hiring and their black markets and tax avoidance are huge problems also france has work rules that kick in when an employer has or more employees the work rules essentially add a whole bureacratic cost to hiring they can't really fire anyone the euro countries iin trouble just want germany to pick up the tab instead of getting their own house in order ryan's budget does restructure entitlements for the future but not current or near future receipients so i guess your solution would raise taxes on the rich which would even cover of obama s debt of trillion or maybe borrow more money thereby putting the debt on our future generations there is plenty of waste in the budget but the dems always yelling about throwing grannie out of her house when that is not going to happen
711050684,the best way to silence republicans is for obama to resign
711050684,it was in prices crashed when the economy collapsed in oct nice try though

711050684,according to a ny times article published on gasoline prices were when bush left office
711050684,i really believe that if it weren't for headlines that read like a earthquake and ' tsunami just hit both shores and took out nuclear reactors and we let chief economists write the headlines there would be a lot less economic panic and a lot more economic reality shared every friday
711050684,son politicians don't create jobs businesses do and business is waiting out this socialist administration we both know that so quit your lyin and spin
711050684,of the annual deficits are lost tax revenue due to high unemployment and increased social program costs due to the great recession jobs are the answer to the deficit and economy in particular in construction since housing is in a depression with less than k new housing starts vs a norm even in prior recessions of m per year and the romney ryan budget would explode the deficit with t in additional tax cuts and a cut in discretionary spending unemployment in construction is the anchor on the economy and we have a massive infrastructure rebuilding need obvious answer to all of this is get folks to work with a large infrastructure program over years but r's refuse to even pass the transportation bill and the m jobs it will create why duh sabotage to gain power very very sad
711050684,for my trillion dollars i expect promises to be kept they were not obungler is gone got is commie carl
711050684,raising taxes is a huge part of their austerity program and look at the results
711050684,what is with all the personal attacks here why is someone a moron for having a differing opinion and which of you are chief economists so you know more than mark zandi chief economist at moody's analytics i really do think that underlying job growth is higher than this and we're going to see that in the coming months really where is the respect every person deserves regardless of their political registration there is not one single thoughtful review here won't ever make the mistake of reading the vapid rantings on the hill's political articles again sad commentary on where we are as a nation sad sad sad
711050684,more jobs lost since this recession began in late months million than the prior recessions combined housing market in a depression with over a million fewer starts than normal construction unemployment is nearly no recession has ever been this deep or this long and is a systemic one not some cycle adjustment it is also global but of course facts do not matter
711050684,uh huh cassandra and canadian bacon will fly also not mister obama is his own worst enemy his own destroyer his own minefield obama is liberalism and liberalism is a proven and reproven disasterous form of government margaret thatcher described socialism as well as it can be sooner or later you run out of other peoples' money mister obama isw out of other peoples' money and out of ideas excuses liberal platatudes teleprompter quotes out of time obama is toast watch see
711050684,trillion in debt an billion stimulus of which only went to infrastructure while the rest went to payback unions the taxpayer will lose billion from the uaw bailout obama s policies have failed above unemployment for months the longest since labor participation rate of the lowest since this is obama s record the democrats in the senate have blocked progress made to reduce the budget by cutting waste their are jobs programs some duplicating each other some training people for jobs that don't exist ryan's budget cuts them to reduce overhead but making the same money available
711050684,all of your rant is straight from the talking points tabloid and little of it is cogent or lucid did you forget that the democrats controlled both houses from january thru january the democrats have controlled the senate and the executive branch for over three of those same years to even attempt to link or blame a political party for all of the things you ranted about is sort of silly and made even funnier by your obvious failure to recall just exactly who held the purse strings for that entire year period the house and senate were democratically controlled at no time in through were the republicans in charge of any of the purse strings nor did the republicans chair any committee at any point during that same year time frame your thesis is just plain factually inaccurate you can't start keeping score whenever you want simply to associate everything with your own version of history you are not implying that the entire mess this country is in started exactly when the republicans re gained control of the house in are you or was it started just for the years george bush was president but none of the and half years that obama has been president with a full congressional cycle with the democrats then controlling all three the executive branch the house and the senate pleeeeez
711050684,yes i did and your figures are bs cooked books learn how to read and not assume
711050684,i thought the stimulus was a little under bill including tax cuts did you get a tax cut out of the trillions wasted in iraq
711050684,no you did not read the report more people employed by the private sector in may than in april as this bls report states
711050684,remember this we don't mind the republicans joining us they can come for the ride but they gotta sit in the back details exactly who has been driving this rig over the cliffs of financial ruins
711050684,not only that the dept of labor had to revise the previous months numbers down ward as they were caught padding the books to the point just like omb there data is no longer believable
711050684,payback unions too much faux news remember tax cuts extended unemployment insurance aid to states to save jobs the auto bailout cost is still open but if we sold the stock we have today it would be about b lost a fraction of the cost of letting them fail and all their suppliers the cost of gms pensions to the pbgc and we taxpayers would have been b trying to simply compare one recession to another is a fools errand or economy's compared to today we lost more jobs in this recession that began in late than in the prior dating back to the loss of housing as a growth component in this recession has no precedent none fixing this mess was never going to be quick or easy as we are seeing esp with a global slump now that our economy is intertwined with the rest of the world like it never was in or even no we see oil plunging as the world economy slows one small benefit of a global slowdown that we are doing better than the eu by in gdp and unemployment a third lower as bad as it is
711050684,here's an oldie but goodie just for laughs folks i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states obama inauguration jan looks like you broke your oath of office time for you to go bozo
711050684,the repo taliban is an embarassment to america and the world they destroyed the economy with deregulation the same as existed before the great depression and then want to blame president obama who has done everything possible to put americans back to work at the same time the republicans have vowed to do nothing to help americans so that they can blame the president for not doing anything this is the most cynical action that the so called conservative party could take the takeover in germany in the s started with the conservatives blocking the actions of the government through intimidation riots and attacking jews unions catholics and any other group that they could point at america is fed up with the tactics of the repo taliban who have been funded by the capitalist profiteers around the world including money grubing americans the president has continued to propose actions like the american jobs act sensible budgets that would expand education fund police and fire departments and provide stimulus for infrastructure construction which would put architects engineers suppliers and construction workers back to work what have the repo taliban done they continue to say that we need to gut government and lower taxes for their capitalist profiteers to hell with the repo taliban the people will win this election in november and the president will have a majority of supporters in both houses of congress

711050684,despite the economic depression that began in both democrats and republicans in control of immigration policy have left immigration on auto pilot the u s admits more immigrants per year than all other nations combined during the past years the u s has admitted more than million new immigrants annually that means more than million new foreign job seekers currently at least million americans who want to work are either unemployed or under employed it is time for an immigration moratorium until the economy recovers see numbersusa dot com for details about how citizens can push for an immigration policy via powerful no cost tools that serves the national interest not special interests
711050684,kill the keystone pipeline be just as spiteful as republicans don't pass a single koch sponsored bill we can wait it out gas prices have dropped that is like a tax break for the middle class

711050684,when you say we don't you mean all of you of course people like you try and drive a square peg in a round hold and call it marriage
711050684,the people know that it is the republicans
711050684,obama's policies have failed latest tally on gm losses is billion if the pensions went to the pbgc they would have gotten a fraction of them as it is the non union people lost everything the states should have been trimming the waste in their states for instance wisonson schools save billions on medical coverage for teachers because by contract they had to use the medical plan supplied by the teachers union by putting it out to bid without increased cost to the teachers they saved billions this is the type of savings that need to be done instead obama paid off the unions with for their support the uaw as part of the deal forced a non union supplier out of business obama has no new ideas except tax and spend more which kills more jobs you liberals will never learn
711050684,business is waiting socialist dear leader you know it i know it

711050684,your comment wold be more welcome in north korea where they belong move there so you can worship dear leader
711050684,i don't think it would be possible to drive a nail up obama's sphincter muscle with a ball peen hammer since the jobs and unemployment report was published this morning i'm betting hemroids are in his future
711050684,and if you believe the report i'll read you the story of peter rabbit you are a true lemming imbuscile
711050684,food stamps don't count mate
711050684,yeah yeah yeah too many talking points and an absece of reality and facts
711050684,did you get a tax cut when president johnson and the democrats killed millions in vietnam you are a brainwasher dope
711050684,obama brags when about a increase but the next month or very soon afterwards it goes down again this is a roller coaster ride that isn t fun and we are paying for it i doubt obama can read a financial statement or balance sheet and a budget to him is nothing but a roll of the dice and adding two zeros
711050684,tea imbecile different day same nonsense do you ever get tired of embarassing yourself or is being alone in mommy's basement protect you lol
711050684,nether twiddle dee and twiddle dumb
711050684,i believe you may be slightly mistake what your speaking of in germany was the german socailist worker's party or sometimes called the nazi party which was and happens to still be a far left wing party
711050684,this is only a battle the war has yet to begin you know it i know it
711050684,sammy i think he's calling for some kind of a conference in bali or tahiti to discuss the problem after which he and michelle ate going on three summer vacations and eight more campaign stops in venezuela cuba and honduras he figures if he loses here he can run for president in venezuela where they're already used gas bag big mouths corruption and las socialistas
711050684,abe you are truly a disappointment to your namesake lol
711050684,unlike bush you don't have to play dumb obama however thinks there are states that nazis and poles are synonomous and will probably jump out of air force one with a back pack any day now
711050684,name 'one' obama program that has worked
711050684,customers and demand create jobs business responds to demand repubs drive up anxiety and drive down demand and hence we get ower growth due to anxiety sad
711050684,the best way to shut up republcans is to beat them
711050684,where do you live russia i was paying in price skyrocketed when obama was elected why do feel it necessary to lie
711050684,no it is with private emloyers and lost public sector jobs making public jobs lost over in the recession public jobs were created this alone adds to unemployment in this recession
711050684,uh huh and the moon is made of blue cheese
711050684,islamic radicals in iraq i thought it was a ruthless dictator and wmds mushroom cloud the selling of the war neocon style did i miss the whole rationale
711050684,there s no sugarcoating this one nah this white house and will sure give it one heck of a try it's the weather no the earthquake in japan no it's the atm machines and ticket kiosks no it's those lazy americans no well it must be bush's fault
711050684,i gave you the facts if you can't handle the truth that s your problem obama is a failure
711050684,lol whatever you guys are smoking must be good your facts are not facts your obama derangement syndrome is the real fact here
711050684,lloyd c where have you been the last years one bad jobs report bs he is a negative jobs since comining into office he is a disaster for the economy here is a few of is accomplishments million getting unemployment checks since becoming president record numbers in poverty record numbers on food stamps welfare cost of stimulus jobs cost the tax payers a minumum of or more per jobs gave the unions majority ownership in gm and dishing the bond holders the first time in our history the union employess owe the tax payers over billion dollars and they made billion last year and where did that billion go to the union employees per employee and now today they say gm is in trouble because of the union pension plan so obama did not fix the pelection problem he paid the unions off for the million given the democrat parties in the and election cycles and now he is expecting to million from the government unions and the labor unions he is the worst president and he was not hope change it was typical politician paying off his donors and that has been proven by the green companies and who were behind them that got money from the energy dept
711050684,actually obozo knows what to do he just left to host fund raisers hoping that if he raises a couple billion he can advertize himself all over the tv and the poor fools who don't know better will vote for him with of voters paying no income tax all he has to say is that he will tax the hell out of those nasty rich people and put chickens and an electric car in every pot
711050684,this is the sugar coated number there hasn't been a month sence obama has been in office the jobs number was not revised downward when they thought we were not looking
711050684,disprove the facts i gave you genius longest stretch of unemployment months since lowest labor particiaption rate of since trillion in additional debt including billion stimulus where only was used for infrastructure billion teacher bailout with some of the money coming from food stamp program healthcare bill increasing the deficit even further and also unconstitutional increased regulations with the number over regulations over million larger than in bush s years facts you don't want to hear
711050684,the economist mr romney is fond of saying that mr obama has no idea how the economy works and how jobs are created the way the obama campaign talks about bain capital suggests that his criticism is correct mr obama as noted above likes to insinuate that there is a conflict between pursuing profits and creating jobs in the long run however in a competitive economy that is nonsense only profitable firms can sustain any jobs and the more profitable they are the more money they have to invest in new ventures with new workers mr obama is guilty not of rhetorical excess but of economic muddle that is far more worrying
711050684,million more regulations than w huh the facts are not the issue the why we are where we are is the issue and how to solve it duh obama did not create this mess neither did w this has been coming for over years and the bottom fell out in no matter who was president we would be where we are or likely worse if mccain had won we have to fundamentally fix our economy whoever is was prez there is no return to the old normal with real estate in a prolonged depression you can either be honest and realistic or repeat dishonest talking points
711050684,regulations costing more than million obama has passed more of these than bush
711050684,clueless obozo is toast it's time for a new direction go romney
711050684,yet another point of proof that obama doesn't have a clue and can't do anything right
711050684,congress would work with obama if he ever stopped fundraising
711050684,you're weird this is america nazi model won't work here we don't herd like sheep
711050684,customers drive demand which drives business the whole regulation meme is tiring and not why the economy cannot get sustained traction
711050684,read other news sources and you would hear about it
711050684,this is going to get good watching a real business man talk figures and real statistics shining a light on obama's bull and flat out lies this is going to be fun
711050684,bain is not capitalism it is a form of capitalism called private equity romney nevet created or ran any real companies he invested in them good for him profits not people wete his focus hardly a qualification for being president mitt's poor record in ma tells us the real story net new jobs created in years wow
711050684,billv you must be taking vallium of the job losses were from the bush administrationsactions to lower the wealthiest profiteers' taxes the same old trickle down theory that go started and was debunked when it didn't work under reagan and the deregulations policies supported by the kochs coors dimon and the other of the profiteers running the repo taliban party once president obama succeeded in slowing the decline in job losses his policies which were passed without one vote from the repo taliban jobs began to return to the american economy that has continued until over jobs over months were added that's a record that hasn't been achieved since roosevelt had to create stimulus through the public works administration in we will re elect president obama because american workers and their families know that obama is for them and not just supporting the profiteers and their trickle down theories
711050684,you have all the faux news rushbo talking points down nice work sorry they are simply weong
711050684,are you deciding who can live in the land of the free is my opinion too offensive in the land of free speech is it best that we follow our jobs to china instead of fix our problems here mr patriot by the way i love america i don't like idiots like you who blow glib platitudes out of your butt and think you have made a valid point
711050684,regulations take money out of the hands of the companies that create jobs less money less jobs created and more uncertainty of what is this government going to do next obama brought this on himself
711050684,ok enough of the crazy you are the last of the holdouts
711050684,mitt knows more about creating jobs companies than obama ever will during mitts term unemployment in mass went from to that s job creation
711050684,unfortunately i read today that he may try to push qe on us come september to boost the jobs numbers just before the election wonder how he'll convince congress this time
711050684,so he did create jobs and perhaps with the dems legislature running the show forever their regulations and taxes had something to do with a bad climate for job creation just like all the states run by democrats all in major trouble illinois calif md mass ct all dem controlled legislature for years that have run the states into the ground
711050684,is anything in my comment unfactual
711050684,i was only pointing out ricky's fallacy in his basis for his intire comment
711050684,throwing your wig at me after your drag show is unlikely to win any war for socialism but it should be fun to watch
711050684,lmao thanks for your non response i guess you ran out of talking points to continue tell me gomer how many centuries of failure is it gonna take before brain dead losers like you figure out that socialism doesn't work
711050684,j lo does being an angry marxist pushing shopworn leftist slogans ever get tiring speaking for most commenters here i can tell you that we find your commie bullshit exhausting
711050684,even your choom gangsta savior admitted there were no shovel ready jobs billion for what oh yeah union thugs how about those investments in green energy companies that just happen tobe run by fat cat democrat donors quite a 'coincidence' huh
711050684,why hasn't your savior with all your wunnerful socailist programs fixed it hmmm couldn't be because socialism fails every time its tried huh
711050684,you should read obama's law review letter to the editor which he wrote while in harvard he obviously did very poorly in the grammar department for attending all these top notch schools maybe it was because of all those interceptions in the choom mobile it's not hard to paint him as stupid when he gives us all these little tidbits navy corpse man states austrian language died in kansas really died atm causes unemployment gave the queen of england an ipod my muslim faith unless that wasn't an error i could go on and on
711050684,the economy is causing the bad jobs reports all totals were down this week
711050684,your choom gangsta savior has taken over gm the banks and healthcare its called fascism if the jack boots fit adolph
711050684,democrats sure do and they'd vote for hitler as long as he had a d after his name
711050684,it is amusing they all have the same old bs liberal talking points they sound like parrots squawk polly wanna guvmint check
711050684,maybe if i had a little choom like a certain president i know then the numbers would look much better
711050684,obama had a chance to be a great president but he has fumbled and bumbled through his four years he no longer has clout or political capital no one believes in him any more
711050684,if that ere true we would be knee deep in jobs corporate profits have sky rocketed since obama took office the test is going to be romneys governor record regarding jobs which was the second worst in the usa during his tenure romney i a man with an easy to hit target on his back

711050684,probozo romney doesn't have a new direction it's same old trick le down theory that failed before and helped to create the against the that we have today the repo taliban including romney have been destroying the balance that any country needs to succeed those with the most paying the most to support the infrastructure you know roads etc to get employees to work and manufactured goods to market providing funding for a strong defence an education for all our children and a secure retirement for all americans the romney plan continues the decline in taxes for the wealthy profiteers that support his candidacy look what had happened from the s through the tax rates for those who made excess incomes were taxed at so that they would reinvest in american business this created the most robust economy that the world had ever seen for the last years the repo taliban have been paid by the rich to gut their tax requirement starting with reagan that poor ignorant fool allow the largest tax cuts the country had ever seen this transfered the cost of government for the wealthy to the middle class time and time again the repo taliban claimed that they wanted more tax cuts for the middle class but the real purpose was to cut taxes for the wealthy they succeeded and now what do we have no one left to cover the necessary cost of government and a weak and dying middle class business has been affected adversly as well with a weakened middle class there is no one to buy products and businesses have not incentive to create jobs because they can't sell the repo taliban continue to 'catterwal' about lowering taxes to create jobs when it does the exact opposite president obama understands this and has campaigned against these crazy proposals to lower taxes on the rich but the repo taliban continue to propose the same old failed tax plan isn't that the definition of mental illnesss president obama's plans for the economy have all succeeded in creating more jobs more than over months but the repo taliban keep blocking more stimulus more taxes fairness and they even want to kill social security the repo taliban are traitors to the american economy

711050684,the point is that the administration plays politics hours per day rather than focusing on economics like they should and whether the politics comes in the form of quid pro quo deals that hurt non participating businesses or damage to corporate bond markets because the administration violated st tier bond agreements for the first time in us history while moving unions to the front of the line in the gm fiasco it does real damage to the real economy
711050684,obama will bounce back as this is only one month the haters on this site are a very small minority that finds fault in everything obama does the majority of americans no republicans take great pride in preventing economic growth to make obama look bad we see through your destructive unpatriotic behavior in november we will eliminate all teabaggers and take america back obama god bless obama god bless america prosecute the obstructionists the republicans

711050684,more jobs then president obozo who can't get over the negative average each month for the dimwitted left that doesn't follow facts that would be the number of people entering the workforce coupled with the number of new unemployment claims then the new employment numbers subtracted from the preceding for those slow on the left your party has not been able to break above a no net job loss he's been in negative numbers that you wave like some accomplishment even though they don't even cover the number of new job entrants romney has had net job increase and that's more then you a sclowns have been able to accomplish

711050684,one of obama s economic advisers goolsbee wrote an article on the euro crisis in the wsj the other day he talks about further stimulus and investment more debt and what the governments should do to create growth jobs the liberal left still doesn t have a clue about real world business and economics it s disingenuous or ignorant to write a whole article on the euro crisis without discussing the failed socialist political economic model and the public sector government union labor monopoly again it s worth saying that corrupt politicians public sector unions greece like financial meltdowns

711050684,using words like ignorant and moron to describe the president in view of this pessimistic jobs report is a very uninformed and parviscient way to look at the problems we face for example we don't have much control over the european crisis which affects our economy until european countries settle their differences between austerity and growth to prevent countries from considering opting out of the euro zone our economy will still reel on top of that we have the middle east issue where talks on iran nuclear weapon have not progressed fast enough to relieve anxiety in the oil market don't forget about china and its currency manipulation which is not helping our industries now that its economy starts to cool as well many companies here fret about what's next
711050684,the existential characteristic of liberalism is self deception those people actually believe the fecal vomitus they spew

711050684,thomas sowell wrote recently on affirmative action suggesting that it provides some like obama with credentials such as his harvard record that he did not and could not earn your note about poor grammer suggests the same maybe we should discount the achievements of any who benefitted from afirmative action but of course sowell is a racist

711050684,the job report the nation is waiting to see is the one from november that reads barack obama unemployed after rebuke from the nation
711050684,this story is another example of the news media turning news into entertainment this monthly jobs report does not determine the november outcome and it certainly doesn't mean that romney's a shoo in if the report had shown surprising job growth and a tick down in the unemployment rate would the headline writers have said it's all over for romney more comments on my blog barley literate by rick
711050684,one month doesn't make a four year term there are other months to be considered you'd say anything just because you want your own greed mongers in office the rest of us out here see that you hate hope change you and w are all about restoring chaos while the rest of us are sick to death of your chaos we want you to get out of politics and move to another galaxy and leave the rest of us alone
711050684,liberalism is a mental disease

711050684,the fact is million fewer american's have jobs today than in until we get those jobs back the country will continue to stagnate
711050684,the only disaster around here is you guys you and the contract on america if you want to talk about sick and tired we the people are sick and tired of sick and twisted politicians don't believe me have a look at wisconsin they can't wait to get rid of scott walker the rightwing liar cheat and thief because that's all you people on the right stand for you stink
711050684,jobs how to increase jobs is not a new dilemma from february through january or during george w bush's presidency million jobs were added from february through may or during barack obama's presidency million jobs have been lost the last year of george w bush's presidency saw million jobs lost the first year of barack obama's presidency saw million jobs lost throw out these two worst years and during george bush's presidency million jobs were created or on average million per year and during barack obama's presidency million jobs have been added to date or on average million jobs per year during both of these men's presidency it has been the middle class that has suffered those making over per year have done fine over the past years the middle class has not shared equitably in the prosperity of this country what policies work and what policies don't work what policies will put americans back to work and restore prosperity to the middle class years of trickle down have proven that it doesn't work some of you now old enough to be the suffering children of trickle down will your children be the suffering grandchildren of trickle down

711050684,the fact is million fewer americans work today than in
711050684,harry reid who just happens to be a mormon is the obstructionist
711050684,why would they do that the right is all about the greed ethic and working together to uplift the american people just isn't in their purview god forbid they should pay their fair share of taxes to help run the country and take care of the people better that they off shore their money create jobs for chinese and complain about not getting more than their fair share to do other than only think of themselves runs the risk that they might be called liberal by their other greed mongers
711050684,excuse me the official unemployment went up last month the real unemployment rate is over
711050684,republicans know very well that the president can do little to affect job griowth job growth depends on so many things including othe countries and their economies republicans have done very little to foster job growth republicans are just playing dirty politics again
711050684,you say they did nothing to help job growth in the private sector but to help job growth in the private sector means killing unions stealing pension funds ending all health care and safety in the work place and the implementation of slave wages just look how your kind treat workers abroad like serfs you're a bunch of whinny freeloaders who want more than everybody else getting rid of more of you in november is going to be a pleasure and by they won't be able to find you in grover norquist's bathtub with a magnifying glass

711050684,lol what makes you think god wants anything to do with y'all whatsoever goes to show what a pack of mindless moonbats you really are
711050684,like the senate did with his budget proposal where it was voted down unanimously
711050684,boehner for once had the right answer for obama and the democrats there are bills sitting in the senate that harry reid refuses to take up if the senate refuses to engage how do things improve i have some really bad news for the democrats if the senate refuses to take up these bills and they lose in november the republicans will take them up and if they work the democrats are not going to win an election for a long time and don't deserve to this is all party before country and people know it
711050684,the midi care drug program unlike obamacare was actually passed by congress with with votes from both parties it's interesting that liberals love to attack the prescription drug plan for the country's senior citizens you do realize that with this program many seniors can have the life saving drugs they need the reduction in er visits and hospitalization more than pay for the drug benefit program it is interesting that a liberal is against the drug program i guess they really do want to kill off our senior citizens
711050684,ryan's plan guts nothing all ryan's plan does is reduce future growth of the budget deficit to and obama's budget obama has already said that there will be trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see
711050684,the federal government budget since ww has always been about of gdp has not changed whether tax rates are high or low today the government is spending of gdp until spending is reduced to trillion dollar deficits will continue

711050684,you mean like the taxes that the treasury secretary only paid following his nomination to the treasury job or the one that kerry tried to avoid paying on his yacht
711050684,you are so clueless it hurts to read your posts obamacare is health insurance reform and uses private insurers not a nationalized system gm how about the govt as capitalism of last resort gm is now publicly owned again nice try though
711050684,the statistics have been adjusted by administrations to hide dismal economic performance the economics analysis at www shadowstats com is much more accurate imo please review their no cost report no hyperinflation special report january th u s hyperinflationary great depression moves ever closer u s government and the federal reserve effectively have destroyed global confidence in the u s dollar systemic solvency and economic crises have not abated precursors to ultimate dollar disaster are in place remains the outside timing for same
711050684,shoe shne boy for two years controlled the senate the house and the white oops careful now house he didn't do a thing because he didn't want to do anything constructive hoping that we'd collapse into an african dictatorship type of socialism marxists want destruction of the current system and then install their dream of total control the only enjoyable thing about a ghastly marxist revolution is that once they use the liberals they kill them off because they know that they are not reliable stalin did so hitler did so who knows what that fellow who's getting cured of cancer in cuba did
711050684,killing unions stealing pension funds ending all health care and safety in the work place and the implementation of slave wages yeah so wassa problem
711050684,hey west winds 'have you thought of trying cuba
711050684,da komerad we are hoping so
711050684,pres obama reminds me of a former boss of mine when things are going well he couldn't stop talking about what his vision and leadership meant to the project when things are sour he was always looking around the room asking what we could do better
711050684,we have totally lost control of the election process by allowing the establishment to use the vote machines they are equipped with powerful two way modems they are programmable the elite can elect anyone they want you all can not do one thing about it without a general uprising
711050684,but if we would ve had today s numbers in people would ve been thrilled you could have had that number in the same way you do today show people no longer in the workforce
711050684,for out of the last weeks the weekly jobless numbers have been revised after the fact always in the same direction higher it takes at least new jobs a month just to keep up with the growth in the u s labor force so march barely held to febuary's by jobs not enough to bring it down to and april should have risen to not declined to add mays dismal new jobs and unemployment numbers and you get unemployment and that's only going back for weeks not the that have been tweaked after the fact by this administration
711050684,i'm going to disagree that it didn't work and i am a victim i am far far more prosperous today than years ago far more prosperous than my parents were as well in fact of my siblings are also far more prosperous than our parents my children's lives look promising but of course they will be the victims of trickle down debt however they both have degrees in stem fields so they both have valuable skills to take to another country if necessary perhaps your problem is that you looked to someone else to provide you with prosperity
711050684,the republicans are happy about this weeks jobs statistics that shows negative on the obama admin but this shoes the true colours of the republicans policies which some of democrats are afraid to say
711050684,exactly which republican said he was happy
711050684,what size are true shoes the dems are afraid to say that their man is the new lincoln in that he is so disgusting a lot of the country wants to leave
711050684,i made a lot of money under the trickle down era any one could if they refused to be a slave to the state
711050684,i'm a republican and i find these numbers devastating why are you more concerned about what you think republicans think without giving obama's intentional job killing policies a second that why doesn't obama skip today's fundraiser whereever it is and visit w guv scott walker and ask you've just started this job and yet you have created and saved jobs without laying off people or raising taxes and you've created a surplus in the process please tell me how i can do that too wouldn't that be a teachable moment
711050684,rugburn your comments about walker are a lie so called gov walker slashed jobs and has left the entire state of wisconsin is disaray he has taken wisconsin from th place in high unemployment to th he cut taxes for the his rich koch like and gutted services infrastructure spending and education and still sunk the state's economy he will be gone on wednesday morning the same should be said about the repo taliban in congress there constant blocking of jobs programs has left the united states in trouble and it can all be attributed to them president obama has led the discussion on jobs program after jobs program while the repo taliban have conspired to block every proposal not caring about its impact on the working men and women of america they are a disgrace it is suspected that the repo taliban have been conspiring with rightist business profiteers to hold back on hiring until after the november election reports on the big repo taliban donors hopefully will expose their involvement in this type of conspiracy before the election
711050684,having those ows acid flashbacks again there butt grease too bad barrett didn't know about all this stuff you fantasize about or he might have used it in the debates stay away from sharp objects tuesday night as you watch ed shultz and that socialist a'hole john nichols try to turn lemons into obama kool aide as walker wins by despite the democrats usual voter fraud man i tell ya' those koch bros are as patriotic as you can get right up there with scalia thomas and alito god bless all those guys and the heroic scott walker too
711050684,just what did obama expect when he's followed the piven plan to perfection it's the whole democrat party that is the cause of this melt down and its everyone one of those jerks that voted along with obama that has to pay for ruining our country for communism if they are not running this year vote them out in the next cycle no communism in the united states no democrats progressive communists
711050684,god said this morning and said walker scalia thomas and alito were far too rightwing and divisive for him he's upset that wisconsin has become a war zone
711050684,oh you were talking to obama i meant the real god not yours i guess all those moderate protesters trashing the wi state house a few months back had nothing to do with causing a war zone or the paid union mercenaries bused from out of state how 'bout them
711050684,like the administration says people need to relax and not panic over the latest disappointing job and economic numbers give it a couple of weeks and wait until the us supreme court declares the signature accomplishment of the administration to be unconstitutional and hence null and void then it will be time for the obama administration to panic
711050684,scott walker brought it all on himself and wisconsin plus you can put the worst state job losses in the country right at his door
711050684,well tell those senate democrats to submit a budget them they're slacking
711050684,please define what 'slave wages' are and are they better than the zero wages that come with the unemployed in the democratic model
711050684,ok you going to call soros to stop
711050684,interesting interesting that you bring nothing to your argument but spleen and fury you haven't a clue about economics no clue about governance no clue about legislating god help you indeed
711050684,please don't interrupt ricky right's rant with facts it's such a buzz kill dude
711050684,really frank that's very interesting if presidents cannot affect job growth then why did barack obama and the democrats in congress spend nearly trillion on a stimulus that was promised to create jobs were they lying to us or just completely ignorant i will await your response thank you
711050684,very strong in the name calling very short on anything resembling a fact
711050684,hey doofus remind me which presidential candidate in bypassed public funding in order to raise an unlimited amount of cash from anonymous donors the obama corruption started long long before he became president
711050684,remember reagan had a plus unemployment rate and double digit interest rates and double digit inflation and in we had a gdp growth rate and an unemployment rate that began the year at and ended the year at obama didn't have to deal with high inflation and interest rates total failure how does it feel knowing your socialist schemes don't work
711050684,jobs per president per year clinton carter lbj reagan nixon jfk truman ford bush i ike bush ii democrats republican
711050684,your ignorance is so embarassing it hurts to read it yes gm is public we said that yes the us still owns stock duh stock is capitalism duh
711050684,when will you obamaphiles pull your head out of the sand have you seen the debt
711050684,your cluelessness continues to show the ignirance it is yes reagan had high interest rates and high inflation one offset the other which was a pain consumers drive of our economy homes and cars are the boggest drivers of consumer spending that recession had a total of m lost jobs this one million in fact the prior recessions combined did not have this level of job loss combined new home starts never dipped below m from they have averaged the last years due to the credit and housing meltdown auto sales averaged m over that period they have averaged m from and will be m this year but oops you clowns think we should have let detroit go belly up comparing the economy of before china and outsourcing were an issue to today's global economy is like comparing a goat and a car but your clueless rants show you know nothing about the realities of our economic situation today
711050684,those facts hurt wish you ever used any lol
711050684,dumbest post here nice job nitwit
711050684,obama is just like warren g harding all charm and charisma some say no substance no competence no ideas everything wrong is someone else's fault how people in this country can embrace an administration whose debt continues to grow faster than the weeds in my back yard is just amazing to me the only bigger morons in his administration are joe biden nancy pelosi and harry reid cowboy festival my

711050684,one of us doesn't understand the legislative system the house passes pieces of legislation and because harry reid doesn't agree with every comma and decimal point it never gets debated or voted on this is the worlds greatest deliberative body my understanding is the house passes a bill the senate debates the bill adds or subtracts from it and votes on it if they don't pass it it's try again if what they pass is substantially different it goes to conference and then is voted on again once the bill has passed both houses it goes on to the president for his signature or veto show me where reid has done any of the above and why his pork laden transportation bill should even get a vote when reid won't look at others
711050684,i'm melting meltinggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
711050684,go read this silly bills none are worth the paper thry are written on and thus the senate decides to not waste time on them the transportation bill is something routinely passed by both houses until now why boehner wants to try and force rhe xl pipeline thru on it million real jobs held up to try and embarass the president and slow down the economy

711050684,good try but having been in the comparison is not the same your post once again makes my point even adjusted for population growth unemployment was m vs m car sales adjusted would be m today and housing starts m so not only has the great recession had x the unemployment but of the housing starts and related expenses and of the auto sales thanks for the cut and paste from a conservative writer though at least we know you can google
711050684,oh so you admit pulling those numbers out of you azz no surprise since you have no source and we all know what liars libs are times the unemployment total bs you can't look at raw numbers you have to look at percentages and reagan had worse unemployment than your coke head savior to deal with and your percentages are from your numbers which have no source thanks for the laughs post your sources put up or shut up laughable you libs sure are legends in your own minds but thats about it
711050684,that you're dumb as dirt and you prove it with every post
711050684,that you personally have taken it as your charge to destroy the legitimacy of conservatism as you prove with every post
711050684,have no source hah you laughably call anyone on not having a source oh hilarious extremist
711050684,home depot whole foods staples all fine companies created by bain while gov unemployment went from to almost full employment he had to deal with a democrat controlled legislature which contnues to drive the state off a cliff the race will be between obama's miserable record with an economy that appears to be contracting and romney who is an accomplished business man and governor who knows how to run companies and create jobs a simple choice romney
711050684,as a republican let me tell you what i love about this let's not argue the semantics of this let's just not pass a thing and we'll go into the election with tax increases just waiting for a january trigger no xl pipeline and no transportation bill with the house saying we tried and reid talking about his transportation bill and let the voters decide who's right i'm betting on the republican because it's so proveable the senate has done nothing absolutely nothing to move these bills along why vote for a political party that refuses to engage just so they can keep the increased spending levels they put into the budget the last time they actually passed one i believe the democrats and obama lose if these are the issues now for the beauty of it romney has an easy job he approves the xl pipeline puts forth the effort to pass a transportation bill puts forth the effort to come up with an energy policy opens up the gulf of mexico once again for drilling and all of these happens in his first month in office do you understand how many jobs are going to open up do you understand how easy it's going to look do you understand how foolish obama and the democrats are going to look for not getting this done keep talking about those silly bills and we'll see you at the voting booths in november
711050684,lets all try to act surprised bo has killed the economy and left us with nothing but impossible debt not the change many had hoped for but entirely predictable
711050684,tell me what planet do you reside on talk about an imbusal you it vern or is it earl
711050684,fact is the previous admin and the current tea party kooks f this over big time it's unfixable with the nuts on the right more interested in their f up social agenda than more important getting the economy moving again these f throw backs answer is to bleed the patient in order to cure the ill they caused
711050684,lets not forget to blame congress for their part no highway bill or jobs bill congress is willing to see the country flounder in order to defeat obama don't forget to note that this include a significant drop in public sector employment
711050684,gunowner it's nice to know that your gun is adequate but anyway no one is talking about the current unemployment level we're talking about the comparison of the job growth of other states and the nation wisconsin has dropped to th in the time that scott walker has been governor those are the facts while walker has been cutting taxes for the kochs and his rich benefactors the state has been going to hell he doesn't care because he believed that he was the repo taliban rock star but it turned out that he is their falling star
711050684,as da wn rep lied i am sur prised t hat a m om can make in wee ks on the int ernet hav e you see n thi s w eb s ite c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k

711050684,uh no the numbers are correct adjusting them for population growth makes the point even more strongly but since you reallly don't care about reality since all you do is insult and throw out bs try some googling on your own facts and reality exist and yes reagan had less thn half the number of uninsured than obama with muvh stronger consumer spending especially in housing to pull us out of recession then he also had democrats to work with him vs today when your team does all it can to work against any solution sad but so are you
711050684,the numbers are correct really why becaues you say so lmao sure i believe libs right lets play your game obama's stock market when he started was about times larger than when reagan took over reagan had worse unemployment higher inflation higher interest rates talk about consumer spending with double digit interest rates to get a house are you delusional yeah you are you're a lib your figures are bs just like everything else you post

711050684,ok clown boy some of us actually are mature and lived thru the early 's i actually voted for reagan twice he would be considered a rino by you morons today i had a mortgage but the converse of that was housing prices were kept lower yes inflation was a pain but getting on a savings account and on cds offset that it was a strange time economically but not at all like now so in m jobs were lost or of the labor force vs m and in this great recession so no reagan dealt with a big problem that was still smaller than obama has

711050684,years ago when the dems had both houses of the congress it was the president's fault but now the president with of the congress being his party is not at fault it is the minority in the senate and the barely a majority house make up your mind either the president is responsible or the congress is but it doesn't switch back and forth according to how much you like those serving over days with no budget
711050684,i would check my spelling before i call someone else an imbesile just saying
711050684,ummm going to a higher number in high unemployment would be a good thing you don't really want to be number on that list the best spot in this country would be
711050684,if they are so bad then why not vote on them and get them out oh i know maybe the majority of democrats won't vote no
711050684,then explain to me how george bush was responsible for president obama's inheritance still can't have it both ways
711050684,so how was it bush's fault then careful you will take away the president's excuse with rheoric like this
711050684,if reagan's plan was such a dismal failure then why does the current president keep quoting him why did we have over years of prosperity until the dems got control of both houses
711050684,read them yourself and you will see they are a waste of time and political gamesmanship with no jobs impact
711050684,just as cynthia responded i'm alarmed that a person able to earn in weeks on the internet have you seen this web site pr ograve uuml dr iacute ch ccedil om
711050684,if all the people leading and working for companies are in their 's and 's how do we expect to ever have the grand designs that lead innovation and long term profit great schemes take people with vision and experience our current leaders seem focused on foreign expansion short term profit cyber trends fads and gimics none of these build industrial infrastructure none offer novel scientific breakthroughs that create whole industries politics friendship and cronyism rules and it is ugly
711053646,thanks obama reid schumer durbin pelosi von hollen wasserman dodd frank teddy kennedy mooocher for your complete failures the last years

711053646,b more obamanomics irrefutable proof that dems are dopes president pothead is toast come november
711053646,q who is responsible for these dismal jobs numbers and the economic malaise and despair that americans continue to endure a yes the buck stops at the desk of the campaigner in chief vacationer in chief partier in chief obama a yes that would be the president that stopped the tens of thousands of jobs that the keystone pipeline would have provided a yes that would be the president that has threatened to veto so many job creating bills submitted by the republicans a yes that would be the president that chose to push obamacare and the progressive agenda instead of focusing on jobs and the u s economy
711053646,more obamanomics irrefutable proof that dems are dopes president pothead is toast come november
711053646,stocks suffered what about the american people haven't we suffered enough since the fairy queen obama was elected
711053646,i guess just saying it over and over again doesn't really work obo and his anti job policies are toast look for widespread white house orchestrated violence coming to a town near you by summer's end those who created the unqualified pos in our oval office have no intention of allowing a free and fair election to destroy their long laid plans martial law is their only hope to retain power and the deaths of innocents won't deter that lust from article to make matters worse the government also revised down figures for job gains in march and april
711053646,anyone else not shocked that the previous numbers were reduced also from article to make matters worse the government also revised down figures for job gains in march and april as it found the economy actually added fewer jobs during that time than it previously calculated
711053646,you can expect more of the same from the commiebama look at other communist socialist countries all have unemployment rates around companies don't thrive in this environment
711053646,time for a change of plans attacking free markets with over regulations restraining oil and coal production and failing to pass a budget just isn't working out
711053646,who cares how many fake stats are you supporting today unhonest abe

711053646,this is the change you all voted for congratulations
711053646,wow what a truly disturbed person you are
711053646,the american people own that stock that suffered today all thanks to mister obama november will be a bed month for obama and those of his ilk watch see watch cheer
711053646,it was coming because every jobs report has always comes out and revises the previous one or two months and it is never for the positive they try to cook the numbers hoping that a good report would be out and when it isn't they have to revise the previous to make the current not to look so bad numbers are numbers but not to the obama administration they are to be manipulated by them for getting the best results to make obama look good but eventually they cannot keep the truth from the citizens obama is the worst president he did come into the postion with his eyes opened and he blames everyone else except for the one that is the fault obama
711053646,hey dishonorable abe do you prefer to be called a creepy stalker or a stalking creep
711053646,when obama said that we've got a lot of work to after the jobs report was released he then proceeded to go to campaign fundraisers i really don't understand how anyone could vote for this man he is totally oblivious to the plight of the american people
711053646,with the debt in europe and u s and no will to address it the next crash has arrived money being pulled out of europe banks causing bankers of world to curse

711053646,well obama's plan to purposely destroy the economy is right on track he just made the mistake to think he could get away with blaming bush congress earthquakes and tsunami's on it before november
711053646,we have totally lost control of the election process by allowing the establishment to use the vote machines they are equipped with powerful two way modems they are programmable the elite can elect anyone they want you all can not do one thing about it without a general uprising
711053646,honest abe ny ny
711053646,are you better off now than you were years ago
711053646,the right wing rants posted today make me laugh obama has done more to restore our economy and deal with the recession and restore balance to our government than these folks can ever admit and he's done it in spite of their obsructionism bush and cronies created this mess and they have fought the pres since day one as he works to fix it in order to be a republican you have to have no memory an ability to rewrite history willingness to twist and distort fact no place for logic in your thought process if all else fails resort to lies and personal attacks remember facts and reason have no bearing on our opinions
711053646,dow still up since obama came in but not enough to get the appreciation of the greedy bastards on wall street who don't like not having total power and control
711053646,don't worry the right wings cesspool on here is not representative of the country as a whole
711053646,that's right jeff and if you and themob look real close you can spot the smiling striped cat hanging out on that tree limb with ya before all but his smile disappears
711053646,looked at a company q on the sec website it had over billion common shares outstanding i am trying to figure how monthly job reports affects a company like that
711053646,a you are both jack dale white and jake so you are guilty of defamation and libel
711053646,robertbubba why'd you drop the bubba guy
711053646,hey dolphin interesting that you're all over sam joe but you give jack white an absolute bye when he's pretending to be specific other commenters on the site not only just fake people but i guess for your lunatic puppets on the far right there's no low too low for you
711053646,and what pray tell are those numbers supposed to be
711055889,dems supporting the unions hmm kickbacks needed for their re election so they pass bills that benifit unions and cost us all more money higher ticket prices will certainly follow
711055889,maybe you should know what you're talking about first southwest is most unionized carrier in the country their fares are low the trick is for airlines to make money not keep lowering pay and benefits so your ticket prices get cheaper and cheaper
711055889,how can airline employees donate to the democrats if dues are not extracted from their paychecks unions are parasitic
711055889,the problem with favoritism given to unions is that consumers do not want to pay the added labor costs companies may then falter and go bust if the government does not bail them out
711055889,again a clear demonstration of corporate greed brainwashing employees' all ceo's have contracts the working class needs protection
711055889,sure unions drive aa out of business like you did eastern then no one will have jobs
711055889,ceos can be removed by a board of directors for whatever reason the board sees fit unlike unions who can keep jobs practically forever
711067265,sounds llike a bunch of paper pushers trying to make themselves look important
711067265,us contractors same old bs in every war in every country in every situation fire all the creeps involved no retirement benefits no entitlements let them live in afganistan for the rest of their lives
711067265,i have a thought how about we arm only the afghan women make a rule that none of the men can be armed that'll fix things right up
711085749,republicans can't do anything they can't pass reauthorizations of current programs or must pass bills like infrastructure
711085749,sen i would petition my rep in the house if you would drop your wasteful spending of every dollar collect from gas taxes cents goes to bike paths and beautification projects cents goes to subsidize mass transit fares an another cents goes to pay out of control union ages so only cents actually goes to improve the highways just another example of the dem's polluting the tax payer pot to reward their left wing nuts
711085749,why should thy the bill boxer wants is pork
711085749,i dought that cantor or boxer have ever even patched a pothole on any road let alone know anything about how highways
711085749,the alice in wonderland adventure continues on one of the most straight forward legislative items next thing we can expect is them all to sing with a walrus as they extend the bill one more time the time has come my little friends to talk of other things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wigs calloo callay come run away with the cabbages and kings
711085749,forget the expansion category for the next few years and focus the funding toward basic repair rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing highways and transit systems the vast majority in the so called expansion highway projects are little more than locally inspired inducement efforts to stimulate new development in metropolitan fringe areas but the build out of that growth will occur over a long time and not provide any strong economic job creation stimulus in the short run what funding those projects will do in the short run is to inflate the land values of local insiders' property holdings and through subsequent actions to sell and syndicate the newly enhanced parcels the profits those insiders would reap will quickly be reinvested into raw lands even more distant and more importantly political campaigns for candidates and local bond elections to provide infrastructure local water sewer roads to make potential development on the newly enhanced parcels actually feasible focusing the financial investment in this reauthorization bill toward the existing transportation network will not only quickly provide jobs in the short term it would also redirect those investments toward areas where the supporting infrastructure needed for development and redevelopment is mostly in place already that could enable actual construction of new or expanded residential or commercial sites to occur more rapidly which i think is the better approach to overall economic recovery for the country at this point in time
711085749,when ever job numbers shows a good and promising sign the gop and the fox news says the numbers are not correct when bad news is correct but my democrats sat down with no counter attacks you democrats needs not to be womem but as bold as an american man
711085749,ok barbara boxer we will pass it in december because what is not going to be allowed to happen is that temporary construction jobs funded via deficit spending are going to be used to pump unemployment numbers and make it easier for incumbents to get re elected you and the rest of congress played a role in screwing up the economy with your out of control spending so answer a simple question boxer do you still want a highway bill if no spending is allowed to occur until december i think we all know that the answer is no quit trying to play politics with tax payer money
711085749,why would congress do anything that does not either enrich themselves friends or campaign contributors i agree with your point and i would include the elimination of funding for esthetics when you have a limited amount of money for road projects they should be used for repair reconstruction rehabilitation maximize your dollar value as they should strive to do for the taxpayer with every penny they spend i remain cynical of their ability to accomplish much other than show votes for political gain and putting band aids on on a terminal patient i hope i am wrong
711085749,sen boxer jobs report underscores 'the necessity of passing a transportation bill' so fewer jobs therefore less taxes coming in means we need to spend more taxpayer money only in washington jeff
711085749,how many unemployed ditch diggers and shovel leaners are really out there we have over million people unemployed and the are not all laborers
711085749,the campaign contributions generated through the longstanding process i outlined certainly flow at least somewhat into congressional and presidential races but are really directed more into election contests and financing propositions at local city county and state levels because it is at those institutional levels where the highway project concepts and development schemes are created what congress has traditionally done since inception of the federal aid program in was to authorize and appropriate a large fund that was then apportioned to states in accordance with various highway system classifications and the mileage within each state later the apportionment criteria incorporating other factors e g population and much later the process of political earmarking started by a few members in congress but grew to become rampant before its recent hobbling i won't say it was terminated because i don't think that's accurate never forget the old rubric all politics is local though
711085749,ms boxer are these jobs as shovel ready as the jobs in were somehow i doubt it big on promises short on reality
711085749,boxer you have been in the senate over yrs representing california and each of those yrs california has had higher unemployment than the national average this on your watch your re election campaign slogan was ' boxer is for american jobs made in america how are those jobs coming along
711085749,boxer says clearly the indecision in passing a transportation reauthorization bill is having a terrible impact on the construction industry construction jobs lost last month boxer in california your state there are million illegal residents and reality is most illegal adult males work illegally in construction yor offce has never passed any illegal immigration enforcement laws and the million illegal in california are nd highest only to nevada where construction jobs are being lost also you politicians are really useless when it comes to protecting the citizens that voted you into office
711085749,forget the expansion category for the next few years and focus the funding toward basic repair rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing highways and transit systems omg a post that makes sense nice to see jeff
711085749,yes lets do nothing and just put everyone on welfare until after the election then the red corporate republican't can finish sending the rest of u s jobs to asian sweatshops to enrich their corporate financiers
711085749,ms boxer spoken like a true democrat look in the democratic playbook for any crisis and the answer is always bigger goverment
711085749,the senate transportation bill map includes millions for the university transportation centers utc program this was added to the bill the last day before voting by sen barbara boxer d calif who was the floor manager for the senate bill these are hidden earmarks in january the u s dot research and innovative technology administration rita provided million in grants to university transportation centers utcs the funds included in map are waste of money no benefits to the transportation system will be realized and no jobs will be created
711085749,sen boxer conveniently ignores the fact that the senate bill is a disaster and the only reason it begins to look good is that the house proposal was probably the worst piece of transportation legislation proposed since the jones act in in all cases there are some good things in every bit of the legislation but as entire bills neither the house nor the senate passed something worthy of serious consideration we are now backed into a corner so politicians can take credit for passing something no matter how poor it really is they see political advantage in telling their constituents they passed something even when that something is in reality worse than nothing
711092207,finally some good news
711092207,there is no way this is an accurate poll i would like to see the framing of the questions everyone i know is disgusted with this administration and they voted for him mitt is kicking his arse and that's a fact
711092207,people surveyed that's the size of my high school
711092207,bullsheet obama couldn't beat jimmy carter at this point keep trying libs and msm the magic negro is history
711092207,fact jonathan easley again prints democrats dream of rainbows and unicorns are still a part of everyday life but he needs to admit here and now that he is a failure just like that clown obama real life knows romney will win in
711092207,elmer fudd could landslide obama this poll is obviously bogus but i hope it makes all the dims feel good over the weekend
711092207,shovel ready hahahahhahaha
711092207,radical progressive corrupticrats have sold us out to the highest crony bidder and constantly manipulate us emotionally it has to stop our national psyche is under constant assault by those who employ the bible of saul alinsky aka rules for radicals it makes me sick i can dig rappin' i can dig scrappin' but i can't dig that backstabbin'
711092207,you really believe that sh t or are you trying to convince yourself
711092207,the socialists have just one thing that they can't get past socialism doesn't work that is just a fact if private business is threatened with high taxes over regulation redistribution and marxist rhetoric they simply pull back greece spain france cuba east germany just to name a few in the end socialism collapses vote romney
711092207,because everyone you know is a racist teabagger
711092207,shovel ready hahahahhahaha my classmate's step aunt makes every hour on the computer she has been laid off for months but last month her paycheck was just working on the computer for a few hours go to this web site and read more x e
711092207,we really believe it ask richard lugar
711092207,i have always found people who are polled say one thing and go ahead and do another so they can run all the polls they want the only one that counts is the one in november when o bama boy's sorry big fat ass will be kicked out of office
711092207,do you honestly believe anything that cnn says they are the cable network of the democrats and obama re election team so what else can they say they can not admit that romney is running them down and passing them in every voter demographic except the black community that will vote for obama no matter what he does to them they forget that he has not help them get jobs but he has given them obama dollars
711092207,that is the best you have
711092207,cnn lost respectability a very long time ago those who watch them see polls through rose colored glasses cnn is not alone i think fox is the only news channel which really balances out the stories however i'm sure there are going to be nasty comments about our republican slanted they think the network is which i don't agree cnn msnbc nbc cbs and abc are all in o bama boy's pocket they are so slanted democrat that its neauseating
711092207,joe you are a teabaggee not good
711092207,polls do any of you ever get called for a poll oh sure they have these polls here and there and whenever i see them they show obama way below romney and i mean way below the left news channels will tell the biggest lies to ot upset anyone but we all know if obama wins its by corruption november will be remembered in history for democrats will lose in congress and the senate and obama will be disgraced but before he goes he will have his sons create madness lord help the innocent
711092207,it must be awful being you just another beta male liberal how do you like living with your parents better question would be how does your parents like you living with them
711092207,all the current economic news has not sunk in yet give it a couple of weeks the job market is awful the dow is headed down and gas remains high with all this the president says we are on the rigbht track i don t weant to be on the same track with him because the one he is on is headed over the cliff
711092207,cnn abc cbs nbc msnbc are all in the tank for obama but this one entity fox news is axccurate fair and balanced that is ridiculous as it sounds actually fox just tells righties what you want to hear
711092207,wait until the new unemployment numbers soak in i predict romney will be up at least over obama by the end of next week
711092207,cnn is in the crapper like obama msnbc is the only cnn watchers ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
711092207,president romney it's done over you don't beat rove there's no carville on obama's side
711092207,commie news
711092207,so much for the green shoots obama is a disaster and the market is going to plummet buy gold and look out nov cant get here soon enough
711092207,not after this months jobs data hits its game over romnet wins pts he even takes states like pa nj and nh obama is a disaster sell all stocks and bunker down until nov
711092207,you are comparing a national presidential election with a republican primary in a red state brilliant
711092207,another hardcore republican racist keep it coming love seeing the true colors
711092207,rofl has anyone but me actually looked at the entire poll the thing tries to claim that of conservatives believe that obama understands the economy better than romney they also deliberately do not list the number of self described democrats and republicans in the poll in other words it is the typical liberal over sampled hidden demographic poll also this ridiculous poll page to be specific claims that of conservatives approve of the job obama is doing as president which is of course simply false seriously cnn why do you bother with this garbage and seriously hill why do you not force the polls you publish to list demographic info that being said if you actually review the poll details and filter out the ridiculous you see romney is ahead by at least a few points though we will never know with mathematical certainty since the poll hid the demographic breakdown because they knew it was garbage and they skewed it to achieve the result
711092207,yes but think about it isn't it better that they continue to be delusional the way they were during the mid terms obama is out but hey if they want to keep with the same lost mantra and chants of hope and change a la the version fine by me he's done he's only left with his base and many as i have posted in the path are just keeping quiet because they're tired of being called racist when it comes to disagreeing with obama's policies
711092207,let's get one thing straight no one is voting for mitt romney there may be a lot of people voting against the president no one likes the flip flopping cult member not the tea party independents only the gop establishment he isn't conservative and he got his ss handed to him by john mccain just a short time ago so you can knock off the go mitt sh t just bash obama its more honest you azz hats would vote for kermit the frog against the black guy

711092207,cnn hits year monthly rating low in may by dominic patten wednesday may pm pdttags cnn piers morgan tonight ratingsthe news just went from bad to worse at cnn after the cable news network delivered its lowest rated month in total viewers in over a decade in april may became cnn s worst month in primetime among total viewers in over years
711092207,incorrect as usual confirmational bias tends to be a problem of the left
711092207,that term was coined by al sharpton nice try he is the racist which is well known after the tawana brawley incident and sharpton's conviction for felony fraud sharpton coined the phrase magic negro in referring to barack obama in when his presidential ambitions foundered try to educate yourself a little better on democratic politics joe
711092207,good poll for romney this is among registered voters as oppose to likely voters which have more democrats in the sample rock and roll
711092207,doesn't matter where to learned it you kept it even when you knew better that's more than enough to show the content of your character so feed yourself whatever excuse helps you sleep at night
711092207,even funnier people with no demographic breakdown by party page even tries to claim that of conservatives approve of the president's job performance the poll is pure garbage factor out the most ridiculous assertions like the one i just mentioned and it shows romney ahead which of course is the reason they hid the demographics
711092207,you are correct look closely at the details on page the poll tries to assert that of conservatives approve of the job obama has done as president they also claim that of conservatives believe that the president understands the economy better than romney then the kicker nowhere does it list sample size by party registration the poll over samples democrats and still shows romney ahead
711092207,nothing i posted was incorrect please explain what wasn't truthful i only deal in truth i am the truthdoctor
711092207,obama numbers will fall after the extremely bad job data today so i predict what romney will edge obama by a sling margin the next weeks but them the job numbers will be in the next two or three mounts comparable with the numbers today so i predict what obama will likely lose the election in the moment i see obama sling favored to win but the bad economy can change everything before the election
711092207,i don't mind living with my parents only problem is keeping your mom quiet coming and going

711092207,the romney camp ought to use some of holder's racist rhetoric regarding his crusade to crucify states that seek voter i d laws to illustrate the ugly truth about what's really happening to the integrity of our election system
711092207,hey joe put a sock in it beta boy
711092207,said the race hustler
711092207,second term elections are virtually always a referendum on the policies and performance of the incumbent apparently the president has engendered dissatisfaction within his own party as well

711092207,the cnn commie news network is a crappy poll about as acurate and truthful as clinton claiming i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky i fully admit romney will win by a wide margin in november

711092207,isnt it strange that polititions spend millions trying to get elected to a job that only pay thousands really makes one wonder why
711092207,the president is facing some serious headwinds of his own making my question is how many mccain voters has president obama convinced that he is the right man for the job maybe who are not paying attention to close how many people both democrats and independents who voted for president obama in will either vote for mr romney or just stay home i would think based on his record the numbers will be huge he can no longer hide behind the blank canvass and let the media and voters project hope and change on him the great oz has been exposed for the fraud he is good man good father but so far not a good president maybe the good news for him will be more time for golf and vacations in or if defeated would he immediately begin campaigning for the president attending six fundraisers on the day the horrid jobs numbers came out and then having the nerve to tell congress to get to work seem as disconnected from the electorate as one can get where are the jobs mr president

711112040,just saw this i love your post
711119917,jeb is a liberal and should just stay out of politics until the bush name is not used as a swear word
711119917,and we care what jeb says because
711119917,just like his daddy read my lips he's ok with imposing new taxes hey jeb how about cutting spending for eighteen months across the board in all departments re examine and cut entitlements eliminate obamacare dodd frank revamp the nlrb flatten the tax structure and as a last resort think about raising taxes but only after all the aforementioned has been accomplished because jeb is his daddy's son he has no problem raising taxes whereas a true conservative would consider raising taxes almost like giving up a kidney but then again no one ever said jeb bush was a true conservative
711119917,i certainly don't care what he says the federal government shows not one shred of fiscal accountability yet they want more of our hard earned dollars that's so funny that i forgot to laugh rino alert
711119917,jeb's personal opinions are not our problem jeb wants yet another amnesty for all the illegal aliens hispanics he and the bush family are the globalists and want open borders georgey bush was ready to open up the corridor to allow foreigners free access to our heartland get lost jeb and take your brother all the illegal aliens and parents with you
711119917,the american people should note that jeb bush didn't have the balls to run for any federal office his opinion means nothing or nada as he prefers bush could have been us senator from florida by simple running but he didn't have the courage or resolve screw him
711119917,who said you were a true conservative where were you when real conservatives voted yes in favor of the patriot act reauthorizations lolz you're no different than a partisan sheep democrat or republican
711119917,yet he hasn't had his republican party membership revoked why is that
711119917,strike him off the list
711119917,amnesty jeb can jump off a short pier

711119917,screw you jeb go away go help your drug addicted daughter do something we don't want any more bush's nowhere around washington dc ok repeat screw you
711119917,jeb bush okay with tax hike there's the problem with the establishment republicans right there after a few hits they cave and we end up with trillion in debt this has to stop
711119917,no more taxes until they demonstrate that it will be used to pay down debt not for new spending every time we assent to more taxes they spend it on growing government instead of shrinking debt and the more they grow the bureaucracy and programs the more taxes they need to sustain them
711119917,there is a fundamental problem with the way our government works they will promise x amount of spending cuts but there is absolutely no way to hold a future congress to those cuts the cuts must be made immediately and not promised for the future if they were immediate i would also support in new revenue for every in cuts they could get the new revenue by flattening the tax code and eliminating some deductions
711119917,bullshat article meant only to reference ol' grover jeb bush says is he running for anything
711119917,jeb bush is not running so who cares what he thinks about taxes or anything else and no one should care or give a damn what van hollen says especially jeb bush
711119917,anyone really care what jeb say's
711119917,we have totally lost control of the election process by allowing the establishment to use the vote machines they are equipped with powerful two way modems they are programmable the elite can elect anyone they want you all can not do one thing about it without a general uprising
711119917,yup look what happened to his dad when he proposed a tax increase
711119917,i like the guy taking a cut to tax increase is a no brainer a bi partisan deal written and controlled by gop would mean that it would actually happen i could even live with that
711119917,isn't it interesting that the headline mentions only the tax hike and not the cuts as a requirement for the hike so typical
711119917,just wondering how many of you people on this thread actually got back all the taxes you paid last year in the form of a refund
711119917,sure glad jeb bush is not in the government now we would never solve anything we need positive ways forward not giveaways we need to have a man in the wh that knows where this government should be to make progress and undue the mess that obazo has made
711119917,the doctor is in cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo
711119917,fact obama debt at trillion dollars anything should be thrown at it now just to pay the intrest
711119917,controlled by gop is different than tea party jeb agreed to compromise tp's know none
711119917,very true a paper trail is the only honest form of voting right now
711119917,i hope thinking and responsible conservatives if there are any left in the republican party will be glad that jeb bush said what has been acknowledged by economists across the spectrum taxes are at a sixty year low and need to be raised in order to provide revenue the more people laid off the less money not only to government but also to the economy in general as more people do not have the money to spend there is less demand with less demand businesses cannot hire and do not invest it is a downward spiral it is common sense
711119917,actually that is not true under clinton with only a higher tax m jobs were created and bush was handed a surplus obama took office with the economy bleeding k jobs a month now months of private sector growth the stock market down to k now k that's just fact if the republicans had not filibustered all attempts to put people back to work and raise revenue to get the economy going the economy would be much better than it is now however the people you seemingly support are willing to destroy the economy in order to win the election they seem to be more obsessed with ensuring that women not be allowed to use contraception and if they get pregnant under no circumstances should they be allowed to choose an abortion hello banana republic
711119917,yes clinton had to work with a very active republican congress congress controls the purse strings and you know how those evil republicans hate to spend or used to anyway as we heard over the weekend from clinton his approach to business regulation and corporate taxation is moderate and centrist unlike what we have now bush came in on the heels of the dot com bubble burst after the tech euphoria that grew the economy and created jobs ended in the 's clinton was business friendly and knew who was buttering the entitlement programs' bread the people i support are clear about prioritizing fiscal and economic issues those who think now's a good time to expound on the virtues of transvaginal ultrasounds or what have you will be left in the dustbin of history
711119917,look what happened with reagan we got the taxes but no cuts why would one need to raise taxes when you are cutting spending i would think that when you cut spending you don't need to raise taxes he more the government taxes the more it spends the more it spends the more it borrows and the more it taxes if they would cut out all the waste we would need to raise taxes
711119917,common sense is the lower the tax the more revenue the government takes in it happen when reagan cut taxes and when g w bush cut taxes the governments revenue was at recored high common sense is the lower the taxes are the more money the people and businesses have the spend and the more people are working and then the more money the government gets no government has ever spent their way out of a recession the government dose not create private sector jobs by spending the past years proved that common sense is that you quit drinking the liberals kool aide
711119917,i'm a repub and the bushes were terrible presidents clinton got in because old bush was worthless there hasn't been a decent person as president since reagan they just look good now when you compare them to obama
711119917,thank you for your response to my post but you neglect to mention that reagan actually raised taxes when required to bring the country out of recession and left a debt not a surplus when he left office i say that not as a a liberal drunk with left wing kool aide but as a a conservative former who really liked reagan government also hired public servants rather than firing them as did bush senior why because firemen police teachers and other public servants actually hold down real jobs that put money back into the economy
711119917,yes but the cuts the democrats promised to reagan never happened firemen policemen and teachers are paid with taxes and do very little to create jobs in the private sector
711123213,great let markey eat some then we'll be able to track his butt because he'' be aglow

711123213,ok who wants to break it to lloyd c that even as he typed he was being bombarded with radiation clearly the canadian school systems must suck too
711123213,apparently markey forgot about nuclear weapons exploded under water off san diego in 's
711123213,oh yes let's stop using fossil fuels and switch to the only other power source available at a large scale nuclear energy then we can eat radioactive fish and meat and veggies forever and ever but at least we will be rid of that nasty carbon dioxide

711123213,we have totally lost control of the election process by allowing the establishment to use the vote machines they are equipped with powerful two way modems they are programmable the elite can elect anyone they want you all can not do one thing about it without a general uprising
711123213,thank you to the representative for caring the radiation in the fish is called cesium and it can cause cancer don't trust anyone who tries to minimize it they're probably working for the nuclear industry or uneducated radiation is cumulative and radiation was also found in the milk drinking water vegetables etc plus it comes down in the rain so we're gettng exposed to more and more every day for yourself and for your family research everything you can about this there are so many good places to start www dot enformable dot com listen to interviews at www dot nuclearhotseat dot com look up radchick on facebook www dot nuclear news dot net www dot simplyinf dot org www dot enenews dot com www dot fairewinds dot com
711123213,democrat worried about tainted seafood from japan's nuclear meltdown ummm you're about a year too late it's been clear this was is going to happen for a long time well unless you were listening to believing the 'gov't estimates' coming out of japan i hope most of us have learned about the how and why of 'government figures' brought to us by 'government spokesmen' best not to 'trust' juse one man's opinion jeff
711129695,jeff flake understands the value of immigrants nannies farm workers delivery boys busboys etc all contribute greatly in the us economy politicians like flake can help the gop avoid long term minority status which is its current trajectory
711129695,the value of illegal aliens you mean less jobs for americans reduced pay rates for blue collar amercan workers increased healthcare cost for americans because hospitals pass their cost onto us when freeloading illegals get their healthcare for free flooding our education system with illegals who don't contribute to the cost of being educated free school meals for the illegals here in the south our american school children sit in classes surrounded by a host of the little roaches food stamps to feed them with american tax dollars un innoculated wetbacks walking around among us carrying diseases we have either stamped out here or have had under control refusing to become part of america how many times do we see on the news where some wetback his lived here for years and has to use an interperter to tell their story send every last single one back if you cant live without them go with them even if you go there legally be careful they dont give away crap to immagrants they also only teach spanish in their schools no special classes for the gringo's you can not own prime realestate either thats reserved for natural citizens of mexico you are a lib idiot
711129695,jeff flake john cornyn lyndsey graham all must be defeated if we are to restore law and order in this country corrupted politicians are wholly responsible for facilitating and enabling this invasion of illegal aliens as they are more beholden to the u s chamber of commerce and special interests than they are to their constituents
711129695,to value immigrants is noble to facilitate illegal immigration is criminal elected officials such as jeff flake have perpetuated the importation of poverty from third world countries so as to pacify their masters the u s chamber of commerce and the club for growth
711180633,yep seems to know about how the world works from an economic perspective my kind of guy
711180633,gave away his inherited money and started from the bottom he's gonna make a great president
711180633,you guys sure want broadcast what romney is worth how come not a thing how much mr obama is worth since becoming president
711180633,yes idiot maybe if you went to school and learn to read before trying to make up lies you would be taken more seriously you are the perfect example of what these greedy thugs on the right want the citizens of this great country to be dumb
711180633,the key to this story is one thing romney earned every penny himself nothing was given him and if you think romney is out of touch because he made money what do you say about people like john kerry nancy pelosi the a list actors and actresses in hollywood steve jobs mark zuckerberg any professional athlete any rap star rock star from jay z to bruce springsteen they all have wealth they earned and might i add they are for the most part far richer than romney will ever be the beautiful part about a free country is the fact you can do what you want you can be as rich as you want or as poor as you want it is all up to you if you have the drive and ambition to be a success you will be if not smoke weed and be poor nobody cares
711180633,john kerry the kennedy's any number of democrat donors romney earned his you're only reporting this because he's a republican
711180633,rich old white ceo representing the top against the rest of us arguing for us to return to the failed policies of george bush nice pick there republicans why not complete the disaster and ask sarah back as vp
711180633,you mean has never had to work an honest day's work in his life doesn't know or care what average americans need or go through but is good at dodging taxes with accounts in the cayman islands and switzerland yeah no thanks your kind of guy is a disaster
711180633,you say that yet we have more than years tax returns from our president but only one from mittens what's he so desperate to keep hidden from us
711180633,oh bull yeah he dodged the draft by living in france on his own dime the man has never worked hard for anything in his life or ever had to worry about paying the bills stop shilling for the top ceos they do not care about you and never will
711180633,considering the wealth hoarded on the left that would make you a perfect example of what democrats need arrogant and stupid
711180633,the oval office occupier isn't worth a dime
711180633,compared to kenndy kerry and every other schleb who inherited their ill gotten gains where does romney rank in wealth
711180633,maybe you should take the advice of mark twain it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt
711180633,dont need to be a shill we blog and fight for whats right whats just in america we fight for our ancestors we fight for ourselves we fight for our children and their children ad infinitum whether the rich care about me matters not they will be rich others will be rich i may be rich but freedom is worth more then all the riches in the world the path we are going down is taking our freedom so we fight
711180633,please go then and make a citizens arrest for tax evasion go full bore or go home useless accusations from a soros puppet go post some more tax evasion lies about mitt soros will pay you dont worry
711180633,fact class warfare is for coddling democrats that all
711180633,press continues to shill for obama while they ignore jon corzine who made big withdrawals from customer accounts and has escape indictment arrest and trial this is not equal justice but chicago politics practice out of the white house and the doj this story is meant to distract from obama's poor and sorry economic record
711180633,unfortunately bob americans have come to know obama's worth good for nothing and when it comes to charity obama is stingy at best and probably a terrible tipper too
711180633,hopefully you are getting paid for your repetitious inane post under different name you are strange no one would believe your irrational posts
711180633,great i'll vote for the guy that earned to million vs the guy who handed to fliers in the community diligently changing bus routes and garbage pickup dates did anybody really expect anything different from the dem loser
711180633,i'm with ya on that
711180633,i would feel much better if we had those failed policies of gws compared to what obama is doing to us
711180633,yup nancys net worth prior to becoming speaker of the house was million when she lost that role her net worth was million imagine that then look at what al gore did whe as vp to set himself up with a nice faux global scare a thon
711180633,good shows he is a business man and not a community organizer now let's get him in office and get this country back on track
711180633,tax returns i could care less about obamas tax returns it's all that other schitt he is hiding that i am interested in
711180633,you know what john nothing makes a liberals mouth water more than someone elses money
711180633,typical middle class self worth but hey he knows what struggling people feel like right
711180633,you spea the truth
711180633,or we could pick a guy who lets say half black only when he has to be maybe born in hawaii but the type of guy who would say i don't know make up stuff about being born in kenya lets make him the type of guy who wants to be a role model for african americans but hmmmm let's make him the type of role model that brags about his drug use to a group struggling against drugs education and teen pregnancy hey let's also have him say he wrote a book that somebody else wrote about himself we should have him make up stories about girlfriends he never had the type of guy that used affirmative action to get into anything and everything including the white house and never made any money until he became president oh yeah and well make him a dem naw nobody would ever want some jack ss like that as president
711180633,the question is not how much romney is worth it is who can run the country and the economy we have a history with obama and it is all bad he came into office with zero experience and it shows it romney has had jobs in the private sector and was successful although if you listen to obama he is a failure well obama is the failure and if you do not know that you have your head in the sand obama is hopelessness and joblessness the key to successful u s is our natural resources that is the engine that drives a good economy and this president thinks it is the enemy muslim extremeists are our enemy and jobs is the cure all
711180633,well stated you're percent correct
711180633,exactly what is the point of this article obama is also worth millions it's not about who has the most money since when did america start picking presidents based on their financial portfolios biased media once more compable to noting mitt romney's wife ann enjoys riding horses is actually demonstrative of how journalists seemingly cannot help themselves you see the media were not always so averse to presidential spouses enjoying equestrian activities back when john f kennedy's wife jackie enjoyed them they were regarded in a much different light by the left dominated media scenes of jackie riding with her children in the virginia hunt country as jfk watched from nearby as were the scenes of her on yachts were staples of the liberal media the only media of the day pathetic
711180633,like john kerry you know the guy that took the easy behind the lines job in vietnam and faked his way into three purple hearts
711180633,just like harry reids
711180633,i don't want ceos to care about me or you i want them to run their business so it makes a profit so it can grow and hire people i also don't care how much they make that is the shareholders concern
711180633,just whisper the word free and progressive weasels like yeahright come running
711180633,romney worth between and million good for him he earned every penny of it
711180633,well said uknowit
711180633,romney worth between and president obama worthless
711180633,do you trust harry reid
711180633,what every american dreams of being wealthy and not having the government steal your hard earned dollars
711180633,class envy challege game schekels for the most hateful reponsense
711180633,i am tired of people attacking people like romney who earned and built businesses if businesses don t prosper who works poor people don t hire people and people don t invest in companies who aren t financial stable your bank accounts home mortgages pension plans insurance etc are all tied to profits on investments stockholders want and should have a return on their investments because they invested their money which helped the company grow get over entitlements for personal reasons and move on
711180633,so he's an american success story but i'm pretty sure journalista jon left that portion out on purpose
711180633,god sent us barack obama to show us the failings of socialism and it's trappings
711180633,so he worked for it awesome job i am considered poor and really i am glad mitt did as well as he has here is what i blieve god has us right where he wants us and i am content with that if i can improve myself i will try i was a mother first and a employee second i was not a bread earner and i am not ashamed of it i have no animosity towards those who are rich if their dealings were unscroupolous then thy will answer to god i have great respect for the romney's and their wealth god bless them all
711180633,at least romney earned his i think obama got his money by corruption
711180633,the difference is romney earned his obama well had his hand out looking for entitlements through people like george soros and bill ayers ect in otherwards he got his money through corruption
711180633,if i had a dog he would look like cisco
711180633,and writing books he didn't actually write
711180633,who cares
711180633,we started after we picked a community organizer we've seen what a mistake that was
711180633,when you are born the son of the two term governor of michigan and ceo of american motors it makes it just a little easier to be an american success story silver spoon story
711180633,chynacat doesn't have any understanding of what a market economy is really based upon it's having consumers who can purchase it's products the wealthy have convinced some of the people that there wouldn't be any jobs if it wasn't for them however it's just the opposite there wouldn't be any businesses if there weren't consumers the problems that economy are having all over the world are that the rich profiteers have through greed and avarice garnered all of the wealth and now business has slowed due to the decline in consumers but they won't stop when they have accumulated of the world's wealth who will they sell too the repo taliban romney's party continues to advocate for reduced taxes for the wealthy profiteers they have sold out to greed they will all end up in hell as the bible fortells
711180633,let's rebuild the consumer economy tax the rich profiteers
711180633,yawn i don't care how rich romney is i find him to be honest and sincere and he cares deeply for this country i applaud his wealth he earned it
711180633,you are ignorant kerry served in vietnam romney ran off to france period
711180633,one of the most irksome attributes of those on the left is their rabid jealousy of the rich obama is the same way it makes me more willing to support the candidate who achieves success in the private sector rather than the career politicians who slurp at the public trough for their money
711180633,honest and sincere i strongly believe in a woman's right to choose then i am stauncly pro life weapons bans and longer waiting periods are essential then i strongly support the nd amendment and a lifetime member of the nra an individual mandate to buy health insurance is a good model for the entire country then i will repeal obamacare on day one he hasn't just flipped on some mundane issue abortion gun control government healthcare are serious conservative issues that just a small sample if you find him honest and sincere you are a sheep
711180633,no jealousy with my post hell we need rich people my issue is all the self made man earned it the hard way bullsh t if you don't think being born as the governor's boy and ceo of amc is an advantage over most everyone else you are either stupid or na ve
711180633,and i'm pretty sure you would support miss piggy over the black guy
711180633,i thought the romney's were worth a lot more than that listening to the obama people
711180633,that's about the costs in as obama's wife eats a month
711180633,he was on a church mission as most mormons do and had a legitimate deferment
711180633,kerry didn't inherit it he married it his wife was married to john heinz a republican senator before he was killed in a plane crash
711180633,sad the division and wage disparity gap between this one who wants to lead he truly has nothing in common with the common man or woman ron paul
711180633,god nah god does not decieve people that is lucifers game and he has had decades of peple in training they got them in the media the government the school systems they are amongst us my friend choose ye this day whom ye will serve
711180633,well said
711180633,oh that was a intelligent answer it is not fair that of america supports the other we have been doing it for decades we have generational welfare recipients who would rather have a hand out instead of a hand up
711180633,excuse me but he still had to work for it he went to school and educatedhimself so he had wealthy parents there are people out there who live on the streets and are getting an education there drive to excell is no different than mitt romney's he did everything right knew the importance of money and used it wisely and became a rich man he is generous he gave over million in tithes fast offerings which helps the poor and probably to the perpetual education fund which educates people in other countries to his church there are countless men in women who rose from the ashes and became great men and women who started from nothing anyone can do it if they have the desire
711180633,i didn't buy either so he did not get my money
711180633,just as mi guel resp onded i am ins pired that pe ople can earn in we eks on the comp uter did you rea d this we b si te c l i c k o n m y n a m e f o r t h e l i n k
711180633,naw you are just pissed off because the chickens are coming home to roost
711180633,i like sarah just where she is at driving all you liberals nuts good job sarah
711180633,sounds like you are jealous truthguy what do you want romney to give you some free money guess what it ain't going to happen
711180633,mr obama would have been in a lot better shape if from day one he would have focused lazer ha ha on the economy but no he wasted a year and a half on obamacare well it looks like his card house is now falling down and the only guy he can blame is himself or bush or the tsunami or wall street or his big pie hole or broken promises or global warming i am wrong he has got a few things to blame for his problems
711180633,i'd repeal it too obamacare is not workable was founded on false premise that million were uninsured and that the us would go broke without obama care nonsense even with obamacare he's left million without care and we won't go broke it's his walfare on the us that'll sink him you know rich poor black white men women black white the fun stuff he counts on to get him re elected all lies all obama garbage oh and in the beginning we only had million uninsured which is sectacular compared to other countries vote this fraud out and take his radicals with him vote it's the only way out of this vote mitt's a good christian man obama can't even find a church except for wright's racist church i wonder if america has these racist radicals figured out yet i do i know what to do vote em out
711180633,truthboy lighten up lots of us are self made millionaires i 'm on of em mitt's just ahead of me by million i'm working hard to narrow the gap
711180633,america has a better chance on electing a man who has created jobs and become wealthy doing it than electing a man whose only talent is community organizing which is a 'polite' word for shaking down or blackmailing much like the mob does when it gets its protection from its victims community organizers such as obama went into businesses and threatened them unless they submitted to their demands obama threatened businesses with the tag of racists how do you prove you havent been racist how do you prove a negative a lie matter of fact barry obama has been shakin down america since he got into office all kinds of czars all kinds of unconstitutional laws and getting away with it because anyone daring to criticise him would be branded racist by the ministry of information better know as the main stream media it is time for the community organizer to go the infant in the white house has failed miserably unless of course this was his original intent in the first place the utter destruction of america truth is stranger than fiction
711180633,truthdoc believes in a woman's right to abort her daughter simply because she exists aborted girls the true symbol of the democrat party congrats the dems have outdone themselves
711180633,i cannot understand the intensity of hate from the dems over mitt's wealth it to million is a drop in the bucket when compared with george soros warren buffett etc not one complaint from the wealth distributing dems about their billionaire heroes
711180633,he earned every penny so get off his back lazy leech occupiers
711180633,check your facts before further making a fool of yourself mitt romney spent two years in france during the s but not to dodge the draft as you falsely allege he was there working on a mandatory religion required mission while married with children he earned an mba and law degree simaltaneously at night borrowing money he took personal risks to begin a very successful business that he managed for years democrat bill clinton described romney's business career business accomplishments as sterling while governor and while running the olympics he took zero salary worked for free so take your bogus tripe and lies go away
711180633,biggot shameful
711180633,that is a verified fact dennis but democrats ignore facts logic common sense even reality gets in the way of their contrived manufactured version of truth
711180633,you mean the failure in our oval office don't you white black purple or orange failure is failure but i can see why you're getting desperate
711180633,let me know when you find utopia
711180633,obamacare is actually a trojan horse full of so many things that gave nothing to do with hc he is giving the irs control over your accounts he has made no provisions for handling the extra million people with more drs if you need cancer treatment it won't happen if you have a chronic i'll child i won't happen he has already taken b from medicare to pay for this scam there are so many taxes built into is farce there will be panels there will be limits to how much a dr can earn it makes no difference how much training obamacare will become a pox on this country
711180633,his father gave away all his money mitt earned his from the ground up your envy is coming through green he also worked as governor for the olympics when bain called him back to save them from bankruptcy all for free
711180633,good for him now where is the same storie about bwhat obama was worth and what he is worth now
711180633,boy are you twisted consumerism works with those that provide and those that buy to consume it has worked for decades we are free to develop and earn as much as we want we were always a country where the sky was the limit this tax breaks helped us all you think not wait until jan ours went down about but you seem to be someone that is advocating for communism good luck with that
711180633,and still generously give millions to charities every year since day one not just when you become into the public eye
711180633,i rode and showed horse for years one of the greatest exercises out there i could even drink a coke and not have to worry about gaining weight oh my
711180633,romney will be richer after he triples h b
711180633,mitt has been steady with work ethics is a proven success has morals and scruples and a family he adores and vice versa he gives to his church and charities freely and generously he admires our military and won't cut for equipment needed he knows business inside and out he takes the high rode but he won't be bullied he won't make enemies of our allies and pander to our enemies i doubt highly he would have insulted england by returning a churchill bust we had been given with love
711180633,well they do have their double standards you know
711180633,they sure have tiptoed around the t missing that pelosi and the rest did away with
711180633,like or th of kerry kerry is up in the billions gore came from money also then made over million with his scam
711180633,pelosi increased their wealth in one year by the insider trading yeah a real piece of cake there
711180633,you have no honest complaint against sarah all you heard was fear from the far left she scared them silly bush wasn't near the failure you want to give him credit for either and i certainly felt much safer with him in charge now not feeling the safe
711180633,just take a breadth and think if all companies in usa behave like acquired companies of bain capital what will happen plants will close or move to china service jobs will get outsourced to india loyal employees who care for long term survival of the company will get lay off and ultimately pe or vc vultures will getaway with all the money and if they fail which happens atleast of the time they will sell assets of the acquired company to recover their investments which of us want that future for entire country
711180633,you are being ignorant he was a missionary then when he returned he signed up back then you got a draft number his was high the drawing was random they stopped drafting right before his number came up i would imagine with his high iq he would have made officer and even a real asset to the country did you serve
711180633,he also signed up on his return and had his draft card
711180633,kerry shot himself in the leg and his fellow troops didn't think too much of him
711180633,he only gave percent until he got in the limelight same for biden both very stingy
711180633,i don't have a problem with the fact that mitt romney earned a lot of money maybe when he is elected he won't be using air force one as his private jet to fly himself and his minions all over the world at taxpayer expense anyone ever notice how much obama loves that plane wonder why the smartest guy in the world has not figured out that only jet fuel made from oil the dirty black fossil fuel can make that plane fly meanwhile we just trudge along and send in our taxes which become his money to burn hypocrisy
711180633,worthless ranting just proves you are repeating without verifying did you even see how much taxes he pays
711180633,hooray for romney he earned it the old fashion way by working but why do they criticise success is it because they are jealous every single president we have had has been a mutimillionaire obama has millions so beat up on him since he never worked for his money saying that obama should take half of his money and give it to the lazy people who will not work like he suggest all of us should do share the wealth
711180633,oh sure sure romneybot pebo here the fact is greedy vulture capitalist mitten draft dodger romney made all his ill gained million fortune by overloading small american companies with debt and ripping them off after vulture mitt romney forced them to go bankrupt and romney shipped these same american jobs overseas some businessman there
711180633,hey logicdriven romney troll mitt romney is a draft dodger period
711180633,and so on the other hand google free video when mitt romney came to town
711180633,draft dodger willard mittens romney evaded the viet nam war draft by hiding out in france the magic underwear lds cult bs does not clear mitt romney of being a yellow coward draft dodger period so are you also a draft dodger like mitt romney
711180633,so since when did mormon missions in france become a higher priority then defending the usa so do all magic underwear lds cult members lie like you and mitt romney and are draft dodgers too
711180633,yep rino mittens romney american jobs destroyer
711180633,that wont happen but thanks for scaring folks scaring them into voting for the marxist isnt good long term policy either
711180633,good poor people that enter politics do it for the money that they can get this is money way beyond what they are paid romney having money means that he won't be distracted like obama
711180633,when and with what unit did you serve ralph
711180633,when and with what unit did you serve ralph
711180633,i thought mick was talking about romney not obama
711180633,at least we know where romney got his money i would love to see where obama got his money for college and who paid for it but these things like so many are unknown about obama
711180633,that's because they are under the progressive model use somebody elses money
711180633,i'm crushed you mean nancy barack harry chuck and barney have been less than truthful to us
711180633,yep i remember seeing all those pictures of al gore and clinton in vietnam i can't remember were they in the navy or the army also obama really trimmed out his military uniform i've never seen dress blues look so good on someone
711180633,good on mr romney he earned every dime of it
711180633,we have totally lost control of the election process by allowing the establishment to use the vote machines they are equipped with powerful two way modems they are programmable the elite can elect anyone they want you all can not do one thing about it without a general uprising
711180633,nope that simply is not the truth ralphy mindlessly repeating a lie doesn't make it anything other than a boring lie but you liberals have never been too keen on facts have you
711180633,name me one just one president who has not been rich for his time in histroy
711180633,and where was obama
711180633,lincoln and richard nixon check nixon's history pretty interesting
711180633,so the blatantly obama supporting media is hyping that mitt romney is worth million so well the between the lines leftist message is surely romney did something wrong to have such personal wealth surely american business model is corrupt if a man can acrue such wealth of course the liberal media omits that romney did this all on his own he took the personal risks showed initiative courage and tenacity mitt romney's years of hard work created a successful business employed thousands saved companies and he earned the wealth he now has but no the media wants expects mister romney to in essence plead guilty to having achieved such wealth since of baine's investments in failing companies didn't didn't save those campanies folks baine had an success rate that's very good by any businessman's measurement very good indeed so mitt continue to defend american business stand up for free enterprise and tell the liberals to go screw themselves
711180633,what branch of service did barack obama serve in what is the point you are just showing your ignorance maybe you are giving barack credit for serving in the southside community of chicago
711180633,john kerry is irrevelant barack did not serve at all either that is what is revelant
711180633,since serving as a community organizator in chicago
711180633,you don't have enough sense to post on this site you are a blind leftist progressive democrat who can't discuss real issues you just spew out of your mouth name calling unsubstantiated ramblings no one cares to listen to your spit grow up
711180633,thanks interesting how many received their wealth the really hard way marrying it it does though give a hazy answer such as washington's he had just wages all the material wealth was martha's which in his day i guess made it his i should have thought of truman
711180633,such a biggot no class whatsoever
711180633,oh ann and mittens sooooo appreciate your encouragment maybe they'll throw you a piece of gum as they alight on on of their houses car elevators
711180633,the modern neoconservatives want everyone to work for free
711180633,the difference is the above people you mention aren't viciouse greedy hateful republicans who seek to destroy any chance for other people to have a fair shake in life
711180633,the job of a resident is not to be an evangilist oh ya bush did that
711180633,oh the tears are filling my eyes as i read those fighting words i'll have to print it out and use it to wipe up my batroom floor
711180633,are you saying the us navy thats kerry served in lies about records and awards where was your hero that wrecker of worlds george w bush during vietnam having daddy make phone calls getting drunk and snorting coke
711180633,sounds like a mormon missionary
711180633,that was the alw big deal
711180633,are you talking about the koch brothers tea party
711180633,if i were as patriotic as romney i would not of waited to be drafted off i would of went to fight those enemies of the usa the commies who had been our allies in ww than became enemies and now we trade with vietnam oh how confusing but thats americas military industrial complex hate of the month tea party style
711180633,romney earned nothing like bush his daddy pushe the right buttons for him
711180633,so how do you explain the many millions of democrats that are successful you think we republicans have a secret code or something that we keep from everyone else nope what we do is get off our arse and go to work every day to try and make our life better we are motivated by success for everyone and see other's successes as more motivation to enrich our lives and the lives of our families by being successful we help other people by buying products taking vacations and generally spending money and that makes successful people bad
711180633,ralph you really need to find a new hobby
711180633,hey brain surgeon if you are going to use the word separation in your screen name at least learn the correct spelling it is not seperation
711180633,community agitators of communists
711180633,i would think that someone like you would have a batroom fits you perfectly
711180633,when you create wealth and prosperity you can buy an elevator from a company that employes construction workers all without tax payer dollars where is the wealth and prosperity obama created
711180633,ralph served along with john kerry the hero in vietnam
711180633,the tea party that had s of s attend their protests then gave us the largest landslide election victory in modern history vs obamas union made ows with bombs rapes arson crapping in the streets preaching communism and get the police with no electoral value whatsoever and lucky if they have malcontents show up
711180633,amazing that the kennedy's wealth was never mentioned nor was kerry's could it be that they were democrats and romney is republican nah that would show prejudice and we know the media is not prejudice just ask dan rather
711180633,well ole wise one anyone serving a mission for any faith will get you out of military for the length of the mission and the other comment you make just show how big a bigot you are btw where is obama ss card or is that sealed up with his college records as well
711180633,god sent us george w bush to show us the failings of plutocracy and trickle down
711180633,at least he can pay his telephone bill
711180633,thanks wannabe conservative coward but i got this i don't need yet another fake wannabe conservative thieving my identity on this site your cowardice is so laughably predictable when you haven't the testicular capacity to argue on your own just thieve your opponents' identity and try to destroy them that way cowardice incarnate
711180633,thanks wannabe conservative coward but i got this i don't need yet another fake wannabe conservative thieving my identity on this site your cowardice is so laughably predictable when you haven't the testicular capacity to argue on your own just thieve your opponents' identity and try to destroy them that way cowardice incarnate
711180633,bo is worth about million romney is ten times more successful and he didn't make it from tony rezko and the chicago mob
711180633,romney earned it john kerry married it democrat selective outrage is amusing
711180633,want to see a great video check out this talented young lady rapping the truth about our community agitator it's spot on you'll love it check it out on youtube if i was your president boyfriend spoof
711180633,i don't remember people being this upset about how rich the kennedys were i also don't remember the dems being this interested in how clinton avoided being drafted stretched his student deferment tried to plead co status called in favors bottom line billy never served barry never served why this need for military experience from the side which normally has nothing but disdain for our service members
711180633,romney did not earn it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth
711180633,the old fashion way by buying companies firing the workers and sending the jobs overseas while he walked away with millions yeah hes a real american success story
711180633,jesus freak
711180633,more important than romney's net worth romney should release multiple years of his tax return now not very close to november the media should at the very least demand that on a related issues if clinton is really concerned about negative campaigning why did he not criticize romney on that romney savaged his republican opponents with it and has continued to lob quite a slew of dishonest untruthful negatives against obama and clinton has nothing to say about that obama cannot afford to leave romney's claims and lies unanswered how is romney going to use the billion he and his related super pac are amassing for this campaign on negative untruthful dishonest attacks on obama and democrats for sure i bet clinton will not say anything about that for bill clinton it is mostly about protecting his donors mostly equity firms on wall street protecting his own interests in equity firms a family member works there and making obama look bad in public to further his own ego and unmitigated grievances that have festered since as my father used to say you don't give your friend or ally advice in public clinton knew what he was doing he simply wants to undermine obama
711180633,what branch of service and how long did you say you served or did you pass the afqt test talk of draft dodgers look at clinton our man bush was a qualified fighter p iloit how bout that boysan
711180633,bill and hillary clinton assets are about the same john kerry's about million and still this media doesn't even bother to mention that and what about george soros the billionaire behind all this liberal mud why they don't check how much money nancy pelosi has or why barney frank today a millionaire was practically middle class when he was elected to congress for the same time and what about charlie rangel today a millionaire yesterday nobody we have a government that is incapable of solving the nation's problems and a media that spends all its time trying to convince you that stupidity is intelligence
711180633,i was going to reply to you but your words stink the stupidity that overflows your mind not worth it
711180633,and you have to be a loser you don't know anything about this man's life has you spent a single minute informing yourself about the person you are trying to trash have you spent a single minute informing yourself about the people you defend have you asked yourself why you act this way i know you don't have the answer i do because you are a moron
711180633,obama served in the weather underground terrorist organization under the command of bill ayers
711180633,separation at least learn how to spell it correctly it tells a lot about your mind it's empty
711180633,a man that envies another man's success is bound to drown in his own misery for ever you will never be rich you will always go from poor to poorer
711180633,you should drop that name you are offending our th president and a very great man who would have never shared so many stupids ideas in such a short period of time
711180633,obama ate dog please please give up this ridiculous nonsense dog lover for romney

711180633,just like obama did at all those chrysler dealerships that he closed and those employees at solyndra that were let go competence over hype romney
711180633,we have a government that is incapable of solving the nation's problems and a media that spends all its time trying to convince you that stupidity is intelligence pretty good analogy my opinion jeff
711180633,i would love to see where obama got his money for college and who paid for it that information is 'out there' and interesting jeff
711180633,why won't willard release his taxes what is he hiding
711180633,obama was dog lover for obama
711180633,president obama saved chrysler while willard wanted it to go bankrupt obama

711180633,tinyurl com huk r
711180633,the class warfare rhetoric of the left is a means to incite hatred against the more successful people of our country thereby rationalizing further entitlements higher taxes the top pay almost of the federal tax burden even if all their income was confiscated the deficit would not be affected rather than hating romney for his success acknowledge that he obtained his wealth the old fashioned way he earned it obama has done nothing but slurp at the public trough for his wealth never informing his ignorant supporters that eventually the free money will run out romney
711180633,saved chrysler not even close fiat purchased chrysler with money loaned via societe generale which recieved the money from the fed in other words the obama administration sold chrysler to the fed and hoped that no one would notice he prevented an orderly chapter bankruptcy that would have left the auto maker solvent when it re emerged and instead made it a continuing bailout recipient the result a weaker dollar and higher inflation even as car sales are still falling
711180633,thank you for bringing up tony rezco the obama rezco land scandal is huge and yet patrick fitzgerald did not subpoena rezco in the blagojevich case now fitzgerald is resigning rather than face detailed scrutiny of his actions
711180633,the election is a referendum on the obama economy as is generally the case with nd term elections attempts at deflection will be unsuccessful
711180633,why wont the president rescind eo his first official act on january which expanded the definition of executive privilege and made many presidential actions and proposals unavailable for public scrutiny what was he planning to hide and what is he hiding now and where are his college transcripts after all bush gore and kerry released theirs additionally eli please post your personal returns online as well
