### Task Overview ###

Analyze the interview transcript provided and predict the distribution of meat eating behavior among the social contacts of the interviewee.

### Interview Transcript ###
- Q: Please describe your dietary pattern, specifically your meat eating habits. Think about what you would consume in a typical week
- A: In a typical week I would probably consume some meat most days. But I do not eat meat everyday, and mostly what I consume would be slices of meat on bread for e.g. lunch. I never cook meat myself, but will eat it when I am out.
- Q: Are there any personal motivations that you have to eat or not to eat meat? Feel free to write about anything that comes to mind
- A: Some of the motivations that I have to eat meat is just that it is convenient and that I like the taste of meat. Especially for some thingsâ€”e.g., slices of meat on bread this is just a habit where I have not properly implemented or found a good alternative. Also meat can be a good source of protein, but overall I actually think that restricting meat is the more healthy option. My main motivations to not eat meat is that I think it is better for the world not to. One reason is climate change, but actually I am more concerned with animal welfare with most meat produced unethically.
- Q: Think about the people you interact with on a regular basis and whoso opinions are important to you. What are their meat eating habits?
- A: There are some strict vegetarians in my social circle, and I also know some vegans. Very few people that I know eat a lot of meat, but most will occasionally eat meat. Mostly I think that are similar to me in the sense that they would never cook a big steak or something like that, but would maybe be okay with buying a pizza with pepperoni.
- Q: Think about the people you interact with on a regular basis and whose opinions are important to you. What are their motivations to eat or to avoid eating meat?
- A: I think that motivations are generally similar to me. I guess that some of my social contacts are more motivated by climate change considerations and some are more motivated by animal welfare considerations.

### Meat Eating Scale ### 

The interviewee was asked the following question:

Question:

- 6: every day: 

For the following questions, by "meat", we mean any meat or meat products, including

It is important that your answers add up to 100 people exactly.
