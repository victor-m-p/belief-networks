        Stance classification is the task of determining the expressed or implied opinion, or stance, of a statement toward a certain, specified target.
        Your task is to analyze an interview, generate the main targets expressed by the user, and determine stances towards the found targets. 
        
        ### Context ###
        - Question: "What are some things that come to mind when thinking about your meat consumption?"
        
        - Answer: Animal rights are an issue, especially for industrial-scale production of meat.
In general, it is an open question to me whether meat consumption is ethical. I
do have issues with eating baby animals, for instance. Are animals entitled to
have a happy life? And does that matter for when and whether we kill them to
consume their meat?   Besides ethical reasons, I think climate change and the
impact of the meat industry on climate and environment are a critical issue.
Meat is one of the key drivers to climate change and there are great vegetarian
alternatives
        
        - Question: "Please elaborate on why you have (or have not) changed your meat eating habits"
        
        - Answer: I rarely eat meat, but do so every now and then when I think it is socially
necessary or better to do so. I would change my meat habits for health related
reasons.
        
        - Question: "Think about the people you interact with on a regular basis and whose opinions are important to you.
        What are their behaviors and beliefs around meat eating?'
        
        - Answer: My friends are mostly similar in their meat eating. Rarely any of them eat a lot
of meat or on a daily basis. The motivations are quite similar: climate,
environment and ethical. There are some people who are strict vegetarians or
vegans and they are also driven by quite strong motivations to not eat meat or
consume animal products. To many of us it is a lifestyle in addition to our core
motivations to reduce meat consumption for environmental/climate and all the
other reasons.

        ### Task Description ###

        1. Identify all the expressed targets from the user's comment. 
                - The targets can be a single word or a phrase, but its maximum length MUST be 4 words.

        2. For each target, determine the stance in the comment:
                2.1 Classify the Stance
                - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR.
                - If it is against the target, write AGAINST.
                - If it is ambiguous, write NONE - that means the user is clearly speaking about the topic but the stance is not clear. 
                
                2.2. Provide the stance type:
                - EXPLICIT: when the stance is directly stated in the comment
                - IMPLICIT: when the stance is implied but not explicitly stated

        2.3 Extract key claims
                - Extract the fundamental assertions or beliefs that form the basis of the commenter's stance
                - Each key claim should represent a distinct assertion presented as directly stated by the commenter
                - Express claims in direct form (e.g., "Climate change is accelerating due to human activities.") rather than reported speech (e.g., "The user said that climate change was accelerating due to human activities.")
                - DeprecationWarningistill the essential claims expressed in the comment text

        ### Output Format: ###

        You must output only JSON format:
        {
        "results": [
                {
                "target": "<target description - maximum 4 words>", 
                "stance": "<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE]>", 
                "stance_type": "<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>",
                "key_claims": "<[claim 1, claim 2, ...]>", 
                "explanation": "<explanation of how the key claims support the stance classification>"
                },
                // Repeat for each target expressed by the user's comment
        ]
        }

        ONLY return the JSON object itself.
