### Task Overview ###

Your task is to analyze an interview transcript and identify the central beliefs, attitudes and considerations expressed by the interviewee.
By "beliefs" we mean statements with a truth value, such as "production animals are treated badly" or "meat consumption does not contribute to climate change". 
By "attitudes" and "considerations" we mean evaluative statements without a truth value such as "I don't like meat" or "eating meat seems natural to me". 
We will refer to all of the beliefs, attitudes, and considerations collectively as "stances". 

### Interview Transcript ###

- Interviewer: "What are some things that come to mind when thinking about your meat consumption?"
- Interviewee: I think I eat too much meat, but it is so much easier to eat meat when one is in
a hurry. In sandwiches, or some wurstchen for dinner, or a piece of grilled
chicken. I do like a peace of smoked bacon in things like bean soup or
sauerkraut. I also often eat eggs and various milk products. I love an egg for
breakfast. But I feel guilty, because I know how these animals are often
treated. I try to buy eggs from happy chicken and meat from animals raised in
open air. But sometimes I can't control that, for example when I buy sausages.
Do I love a nice wiener wurst! But who knows where that meat comes from. I
shudder to think. Or, when I order a nice wiener schnitzel in a restaurant - who
knows where the meat comes from. So I try to not think about that when I can't
do anything about it, but it doesn't stop me from ordering such food, and this
makes me conflicted. Also, I wish I would invest more time in buying fresh
vegetables and preparing vegetable dishes. But I always end up doing something
else instead of investing time in that. That also frustrates me, both because I
eat meat from potentially abused animals, and because it would be healthier to
eat more vegetables. And of course there is the environment. I don't like the
idea that I am contributing to global warming. That said, I am double conflicted
here because I don't have a good idea how much would changing my meat
consumption habits actually contribute to resolving this problem. Maybe there
are other things I could change that would have much more impact. Maybe I should
recycle more. Or buy more second-hand clothes. Or heat the apartment less.

- Interviewer: "Please elaborate on why you have (or have not) changed your meat eating habits"
- Interviewee: Convenience, we have several recipes that we know how to do and about half
involves meat. Before we had difficulty to buy good fresh vegetables in the US,
now we often miss the farmer's markets because we procrastinate in the mornings
when we'd have time to go.

- Interviewer: "Think about people important to you. What are their behaviors and beliefs around meat eating?"
- Interviewee: My husband is very similar to me. It seems that most of my colleagues eat less
meat than me, certainly not more. Of my friends, there are some that eat much
more meat than me, but most eat about the same amount or less. I think many
people I know try to buy some kind of humanely raised animal products but I am
not sure.

### Instructions ###

1. Identify stances (beliefs, attitudes, considerations):
- Formulate each stance as a short statemtent starting exactly with: "I agree with the following: <...>".
- Avoid empty statements such as "some people avoid eating meat because of important reasons".

2. Rate importance for each stance:
- Classify how important each stance (belief, attitude, consideration) is to the interviewee in the context of meat consumption.
- Return your answer as one of [LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH] where LOW are not very important and HIGH are extremely important. 

### Output Format (JSON ONLY) ###

// Repeat for each stance expressed by the interviewee
]
}

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
