You will analyze a transcript of an interview about meat eating.
From this transcript a number of stances (beliefs, attitudes, concerns) related to meat eating were extracted.
Your job is to analyze the interview and find all stances that are related for the interviewee.

### Definitions ###
- "Related" means there is a clear logical, conceptual, argumentative, or social connection.
- A "POSITIVE" relation means that the two targets reinforce, support, or align with each other (they tend to go together).
- A "NEGATIVE" relation means that the two targets conflict, oppose, contradict, or are mutually incompatible (they tend not to go together).
- Do not use POSITIVE/NEGATIVE as a normative judgment (good/bad) but think in terms of reinforcement (POSITIVE) or conflict (NEGATIVE)

### Examples ###
- Two negative outcomes can have a POSITIVE relationship if one reinforces or leads to the other (e.g., meat consumption reinforces climate change concerns).
- Two positive outcomes can have a NEGATIVE relationship if they conflict or oppose each other (e.g., health benefits from meat reduction conflicting with personal enjoyment of meat).

### Interview Excerpt ###
- Question: "What are some things that come to mind when thinking about your meat consumption?"
- Answer: I think I eat too much meat, but it is so much easier to eat meat when one is in
a hurry. In sandwiches, or some wurstchen for dinner, or a piece of grilled
chicken. I do like a peace of smoked bacon in things like bean soup or
sauerkraut. I also often eat eggs and various milk products. I love an egg for
breakfast. But I feel guilty, because I know how these animals are often
treated. I try to buy eggs from happy chicken and meat from animals raised in
open air. But sometimes I can't control that, for example when I buy sausages.
Do I love a nice wiener wurst! But who knows where that meat comes from. I
shudder to think. Or, when I order a nice wiener schnitzel in a restaurant - who
knows where the meat comes from. So I try to not think about that when I can't
do anything about it, but it doesn't stop me from ordering such food, and this
makes me conflicted. Also, I wish I would invest more time in buying fresh
vegetables and preparing vegetable dishes. But I always end up doing something
else instead of investing time in that. That also frustrates me, both because I
eat meat from potentially abused animals, and because it would be healthier to
eat more vegetables. And of course there is the environment. I don't like the
idea that I am contributing to global warming. That said, I am double conflicted
here because I don't have a good idea how much would changing my meat
consumption habits actually contribute to resolving this problem. Maybe there
are other things I could change that would have much more impact. Maybe I should
recycle more. Or buy more second-hand clothes. Or heat the apartment less.

- Question: "Please elaborate on why you have (or have not) changed your meat eating habits"
- Answer: Convenience, we have several recipes that we know how to do and about half
involves meat. Before we had difficulty to buy good fresh vegetables in the US,
now we often miss the farmer's markets because we procrastinate in the mornings
when we'd have time to go.

- Question: "Think about people important to you. What are their behaviors and beliefs around meat eating?"
- Answer: My husband is very similar to me. It seems that most of my colleagues eat less
meat than me, certainly not more. Of my friends, there are some that eat much
more meat than me, but most eat about the same amount or less. I think many
people I know try to buy some kind of humanely raised animal products but I am
not sure.

### Targets ###
The following stances (opinions, attitudes, concerns) were identified as held by the interviewee:

- I agree with the following: eating too much meat is bad
- I agree with the following: meat is convenient
- I agree with the following: animals are often treated badly in the meat industry
- I agree with the following: I love eating meat
- I agree with the following: buying eggs from happy chickens and meat from animals raised in open air is important
- I agree with the following: I feel guilty about eating meat
- I agree with the following: eating meat contributes to global warming
- I agree with the following: changing my meat consumption habits may not significantly contribute to resolving global warming
- I agree with the following: I wish I would invest more time in buying fresh vegetables and preparing vegetable dishes
- I agree with the following: it would be healthier to eat more vegetables

### Task ###

1. Find stances that POSITIVELY reinforce each other or NEGATIVELY conflict with each other. 
2. Classify whether the direction is POSTIVE or NEGATIVE 
3. Classify whether the relation is EXPLICIT (directly stated) or IMPLICIT (implied but not stated).
4. Provide a brief explanation of why the two stances are related for the interviewee.

### Output Format (JSON ONLY) ###
{
"results": [
{
        "stance_1": "<full stance>",
        "stance_2": "<full stance>",
        "direction": "<one among [POSITIVE, NEGATIVE]>",
        "relation_type": "<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>",
        "explanation": "the two stances are related because: <explanation>"
}
// Repeat for each relation between stances that is discovered
]
}

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
