        ### Interview Transcript ###
        - Question: "What are some things that come to mind when thinking about your meat consumption?"
        
        - Answer: meat consumptions can be not environmentally friendly. I usually consume meat
because of practicality, nutritional value, and affordability. Besides that, I
think it's easier to make dishes with meat tastier rather than being all vegan
        
        - Question: "Please elaborate on why you have (or have not) changed your meat eating habits"
        
        - Answer: I have not changed it because I don't feel the need to. I understand about the
environmental concern surrounding the meat production, but I don't feel
obligated to reduce my meat consumption. Maybe compared to an average person in
the US or other meat-eating countries, I am consuming below the average. If the
default option of meat is readily accessible and tastes good, I won't mind
changing my habit. But for now, I think I'll stay with my default.
        
        - Question: "Think about the people you interact with on a regular basis and whose opinions are important to you.
        What are their behaviors and beliefs around meat eating?'
        
        - Answer: People around me mostly still eat meat. They seem to be doing so because of
various reasons. However, not many of them have a strong opinion about meat.
Only a few expressed environmental concern regarding eating too much meat.
