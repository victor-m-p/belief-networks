        Stance classification is the task of determining the expressed or implied opinion, or stance, of a statement toward a certain, specified target.
        Your task is to analyze an interview about meat eating and to generate all beliefs that are relevant to the interviewee in this context.

        ### Interview Transcript ###
        - Question: "Please talk to me a bit about political topics that concern you"
        
        - Answer: 
The first thing that comes to mind is the rise of authoritarianism. 
Basically I am afraid of wars and instability.
I am afraid that Europe is getting left behind economically.
That the United States and China are winning the AI race and attracting more growth and opportunity.
And that Europe and a few other countries now (with Trump) seem very alone,
Both in terms of upholding the values (democracy, liberalism, etc.) that I value,
But also militarily (e.g., NATO) and economically. 
Even in Europe there seems to be a recent trend towards right-wing authoritarianism.
There is this incredible backlash against “woke” culture which I think is extremely dangerous.
I can definitely understand some of the frustration with identity politics, and DEI, 
And I think that the elites have focused too much on race and identity, and focused too little on class.
I can understand that some white working class people feel that they do not have privilege. 
But I think that the target of the anger, often minority groups is misguided.
I really think that the driver of a lot of the anger that we are seeing in the world is more systemic and economic.
In particular, inequality and poverty is extremely dangerous.
It never bodes well when parents cannot promise and provide a better future for their kids, 
And this is true for many normal people—especially in the places where the backlash is strongest. 
That being said I must also say that I am myself mixed on the immigration question.
On the one hand I think that we desperately need immigration, partly because of demographic shifts.
And I think that we should be much more open to economic immigration (at least).
My main concern is that it is difficult to integrate people from cultures that are very dissimilar. 
I do think that it is true that most people in the world do not share our perception of women,
LGBT, etc. in Denmark, and this is a liberal and progressive culture that we should protect.
This is probably also part of the reason that I am so torn on the Israel-Palestine conflict.


        ### Task Description ###

        1. Identify all the expressed targets that the interviewee holds. 
                - The targets can be a single word or a multi-word concept (e.g., climate change), but must NEVER be more than one concept.
                - The maximum length of the target MUST be 4 words.
                - Do never use the word AND. 

        2. For each target, determine the stance that is expressed:
                2.1. Classify the stance towards the target 
                - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR.
                - If the stance is against the target, write AGAINST.
                - If stance is mixed--both FOR and AGAINST, or TORN--write MIXED.
                - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE - that means the user is clearly speaking about the topic but the stance is not clear.
        
                2.2. Evaluate the importance of the stance to the interviewee:
                - Label the least important stances "WEAK"
                - Label the most important stances "STRONG"
                - Label the rest of the stances "MEDIUM"
            
                2.3. Provide the stance type:
                - EXPLICIT: when the stance is directly stated in the comment
                - IMPLICIT: when the stance is implied but not explicitly stated

        3. Provide explanations (from the viewpoint of the interviewee)
                - For each stance provide a brief explanation for the provided stance.
                - ALWAYS start explanations like this "I agree with the following: ..." 

        ### Output Format: ###

        You must output only JSON format:
        {
        "results": [
                {
                "target": "<target description - maximum 4 words>", 
                "stance": "<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, MIXED, NONE]>", 
                "importance": "<one of [WEAK, MEDIUM, STRONG]>",
                "stance_type": "<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>",
                "explanation": "<I agree with the following: ...>"
                },
                // Repeat for each target expressed by the user's comment
        ]
        }

        ONLY return the JSON object itself.
